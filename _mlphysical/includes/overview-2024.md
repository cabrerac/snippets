\section{Course Overview}

\notes{Machine Learning and the Physical World is an eight-week course that introduces you to the concepts that are important as we try to use machine learning techniques to better understand the world around us.}

\notes{Welcome to this course!}

\newslide{Course Overview}

* Week 5:
  1. Sensitivity Analysis. Lecturer: Neil D. Lawrence
  2. Multifidelity Modelling. Lecturer: Neil D. Lawrence

\subsection{Special Topics}

\notes{For weeks 6-8 we will have a series of guest lectures, followed by discussions that will relate the material you have learnt to applications in the real world.}

\slides{* Weeks 6-8 will involve three special topics.
* In 2020 we had:
    * Simulation in the Covid-19 Pandemic (Andrei Paleyes, Cambridge and DELVE)
    * Climate Modelling (Scott Hoskins, BAS)
    * Simulation and Personalized Medicine (Javier Gonzalez, Microsoft Research)}

\notes{These guest lectures focus on various approaches to simulating the physical world around us, and we will invite you (as part of your mini projects) to consider how important questions around these approaches can be answered as part with the techniques you’ve learnt in the module.}


\subsection{Assessment}

\notes{There are two forms of assessment. Firstly, we will ask you to a "lab sheet" of answer (based on the notes we provide). The lab can be completed using python and the jupyter notebook (for example on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)). This will be completed by Week 5 and is worth 15%.}

\notes{We will use the examples we present this year to help inspire a set of mini projects for you to work on in small groups. The aim will be to produce a report on the different challenges, detailing what questions you asked and how you answered them using the techniques we’ll teach. This is submitted first day of Lent term and is worth 85%.}

\slides{* Lab sheet for completion by end of Week 5.
* Mini projects starting in Week 6 in small groups deploying lessons you’ve learnt}

\subsection{Course Material}

\notes{Since the breakthrough results in machine learning as applied to tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, language translation, etc., there has been an increasing interest in machine learning techniques as an approach to artificial intelligence.}

\notes{However, one area where machine learning has (perhaps) made less progress is in those problems where we have a physical understanding of the system.}
