\section{Computational Decisions}

\notes{When working with computational systems, we often need to make decisions about how to allocate finite computational resources. These decisions should be guided by principled considerations of uncertainty and information gain.}

\subsection{Key Questions}

\notes{The key questions we need to consider are:

1. **Computational Cost-Benefit**: How much knowledge will we gain from additional computation relative to its cost?

2. **Uncertainty Reduction**: Which computations will most effectively reduce our uncertainty about the quantity of interest?

3. **Computational Trust**: How much should we trust the results of our computations?

4. **Downstream Impact**: How should computational uncertainty influence decisions in downstream tasks?}

\notes{These questions can be formalized through the lens of statistical decision theory, where we consider:

$$\text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}$$

Each component introduces its own form of uncertainty that needs to be quantified and managed.}
