\section{Applications and Case Studies}

\subsection{Optimization Problems}

\notes{One important application area is optimization, where probabilistic numerics can help with:

* Choosing between different optimization algorithms
* Deciding when to terminate optimization
* Understanding algorithm behavior on different problem classes

For example, consider how different optimizers in `scipy.optimize.minimize` make different implicit assumptions about the objective function.}

\subsection{Differential Equations}

\notes{Probabilistic approaches to solving differential equations offer several advantages:

* Uncertainty quantification in the solution
* Adaptive step size selection
* Error estimation
* Memory-efficient implementations

Recent work has shown how to construct adaptive probabilistic ODE solvers that maintain reasonable memory requirements while providing uncertainty estimates.}

\subsection{Linear Algebra}

\notes{In linear algebra, probabilistic numerics can help with:

* Matrix inversion
* Eigenvalue computation
* Linear system solving
* Condition number estimation

These methods are particularly valuable when dealing with large-scale systems where traditional error bounds are difficult to compute.}
