\section{Why Probabilistic Numerics?}

\notes{There are several compelling reasons to adopt a probabilistic approach to numerical computation:}

\subsection{Algorithm Understanding}

\notes{For any given numerical problem, we typically have multiple algorithms available:
* Each may give slightly different results
* Each makes implicit assumptions about the problem
* Understanding these as prior assumptions helps in algorithm selection}

\subsection{Uncertainty Propagation}

\notes{Probabilistic numerics allows us to:
* Quantify uncertainty in computational results
* Propagate this uncertainty to downstream tasks
* Make informed decisions about computational resources
* Understand the reliability of our computations}

\subsection{Scientific Progress}

\notes{As noted by Chomsky, there is a novel interpretation of success in machine learning - it measures success by how well we can approximate unanalyzed data. Probabilistic numerics extends this view to computation itself, providing a framework for reasoning about computational approximations.}
