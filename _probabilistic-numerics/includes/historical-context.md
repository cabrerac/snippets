\section{Historical Context}

\notes{The idea of treating numerical computation probabilistically has a rich history in mathematics and computing.}

\subsection{Early Pioneers}

\notes{Several key figures shaped the development of probabilistic approaches to computation:

* **Albert Valentionvic Suldin (1924-1996)** developed error-minimizing estimators for numerical algorithms, viewing them from a statistical perspective.

* **Frederick Michael Larkin (1936-1982)** pioneered the incorporation of prior knowledge into numerical algorithms to make calculations more robust.

* **John von Neumann** recognized in 1947 that even deterministic round-off errors might be better treated probabilistically.}

\subsection{Statistical Learning and Computation}

\notes{The relationship between statistical learning and computation was further illuminated by developments in regression and factor analysis:

* **Legendre (1805)** introduced least squares as an algorithm to reduce "error"
* **Gauss (1809)** provided the statistical interpretation assuming i.i.d. Gaussian noise
* **Spearman (1904)** proposed factor analysis algorithms
* **Hotelling (1936)** formalized these ideas in statistical terms}
