\subsection{Difficulty for Probabilistic Approaches}

\notes{The challenge for composition of probabilistic models is that you need to propagate a probability densities through non linear mappings. This allows you to create broader classes of probability density. Unfortunately it renders the resulting densities *intractable*.}\slides{
* Propagate a probability distribution through a non-linear mapping.

* Normalisation of distribution becomes intractable.
