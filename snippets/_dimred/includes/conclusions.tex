\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item We've advocated Dimenstionality Reduction as a good way of 
modeling in high dimensions.
\item Spectral techniques lead to convex algorithms.
\item Probabilistic techniques map the ``correct way'' around.

\begin{itemize}
\item This leads to problems with local minima.
\end{itemize}
\item Have shown ability of probabilistic techniques to deal with high dimensional data.
\end{itemize}
