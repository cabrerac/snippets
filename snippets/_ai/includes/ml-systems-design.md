### Machine Learning Systems Design

* Major new challenge for systems designers.

* Internet of Intelligence but currently:

	* AI systems are currently *fragile*

### Fragility of AI Systems

* They are componentwise built from ML Capabilities.

* Each capability is independently constructed and verified.

   * Pedestrian detection
   * Road line detection

* Important for verification purposes.

### Rapid Reimplementation

* Whole systems are being deployed.

* But they change their environment.

* The experience evolved adversarial behaviour.

### Turnaround And Update

* There is a massive need for turn around and update

* A redeploy of the entire system.
     *  This involves changing the way we design and deploy.

* Early Example: Stuxnet.
