### Fragility of AI Systems

* They are componentwise built from ML Capabilities.
* Each capability is independently constructed and verified.
    * Pedestrian detection
    * Road line detection
* Important for verification purposes.

### Rapid Reimplementation

* Whole systems are being deployed.
* But they change their environment.
* The experience evolved adversarial behaviour.

### Adversaries

* Stuxnet
* Mischevious-Adversarial

### Turnaround And Update

* There is a massive need for turn around and update
* A redeploy of the entire system.
    * This involves changing the way we design and deploy.
* Interface between security engineering and machine learning.

### Peppercorns

* A new name for system failures which aren't bugs.
* Difference between finding a fly in your soup vs a peppercorn in
  your soup.
