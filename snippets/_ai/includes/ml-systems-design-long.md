### Fragility of AI Systems

* They are componentwise built from ML Capabilities.

* Each capability is independently constructed and verified.

   * Pedestrian detection
   * Road line detection

* Important for verification purposes.

### Rapid Reimplementation

* Whole systems are being deployed.

* But they change their environment.

* The experience evolved adversarial behaviour.

### Turnaround And Update

* There is a massive need for turn around and update

* A redeploy of the entire system.

	*  This involves changing the way we design and deploy.

* Interface between security engineering and machine learning.

### Peppercorns

* A new name for system failures which aren't bugs.

* Difference between finding a fly in your soup vs a peppercorn in
  your soup.
