\subsection{Turing AI Fellowship}

\slides{
* Work in this space now funded by a [Senior AI Fellowship at the Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/welcoming-world-class-turing-ai-fellows-institute). 
}


\subsection{Project Description}

> It used to be true that computers only did what we programmed them to do, but today AI systems are learning from our data. This introduces new problems in how these systems respond to their environment. 
>
>We need to better monitor how data is influencing decision making and take corrective action as required. 
>
>This project addresses that challenge.


\subsection{Aim}

\notes{Our aim is to scale our ability to deploy safe and reliable AI
solutions. Our technical approach is to do this through *data-oriented
software engineering* practices and *deep system emulation*. We will do this through  a
significant extension of the notion of Automated ML
(AutoML) to Automated AI (AutoAI), this relies on a shift from Bayesian Optimisation to *Bayesian System Optimisation*. The project will
develop a toolkit for automating the deployment, maintenance and
monitoring of artificial intelligence systems.}

\subsection{Motivating Example}

\include{_ai/includes/safe-boda.md}

\notes{SafeBoda and other projects like [Kudu](https://kudu.ug/about/) provide us with our motivating examples. Our aim is to create an ecosystem for machine learing system deployment that minimises the operational load. Ideally, we would like complex AI systems to be maintainable by a small team, e.g. two people, with Masters-level education from the institutions that host Data Science Africa (e.g. Ashesi University, Makerere University, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, AUST, AIST, Addis Ababa).}
