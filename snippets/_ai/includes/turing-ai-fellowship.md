\subsection{Challenge}

> It used to be true that computers only did what we programmed them to do, but today AI systems are learning from our data. This introduces new problems in how these systems respond to their environment. 
>
>We need to better monitor how data is influencing decision making and take corrective action as required. 


\subsection{Aim}

\notes{Our aim is to scale our ability to deploy safe and reliable AI
solutions. Our technical approach is to do this through *data-oriented
software engineering* practices and *deep system emulation*. We will do this through  a
significant extension of the notion of Automated ML
(AutoML) to Automated AI (AutoAI), this relies on a shift from Bayesian Optimisation to *Bayesian System Optimisation*. The project will
develop a toolkit for automating the deployment, maintenance and
monitoring of artificial intelligence systems.}

* Scale safe and reliable AI solutions. 
* Move from Auto ML to Auto AI
* Bayesian Optimisation to Bayesian System Optimisation

\subsection{Turing AI Fellowship}

\slides{
* Work in this space now funded by a [Senior AI Fellowship at the Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/welcoming-world-class-turing-ai-fellows-institute).

\notes{From December 2019 I begin a [Senior AI Fellowship at the Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/welcoming-world-class-turing-ai-fellows-institute) funded by the Office for AI to investigate the consequences of deploying complex AI systems.

The notion relates from the "Promise of AI": it promises to be the first generation of automation technology that will adapt to us, rather than us adapting to it. The premise of the project is that this promise will remain unfulfilled with current approaches to systems design and deployment.}

\notes{SafeBoda and other projects like [Kudu](https://kudu.ug/about/) provide us with our motivating examples. Our aim is to create an ecosystem for machine learing system deployment that minimises the operational load. Ideally, we would like complex AI systems to be maintainable by a small team, e.g. two people, with Masters-level education from the institutions that host Data Science Africa (e.g. Ashesi University, Makerere University, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, AUST, AIST, Addis Ababa).}

\notes{As of 24th October 2019, the [Turing Institute announced](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/welcoming-world-class-turing-ai-fellows-institute) that this work has been funded through a Turing Institute Senior AI Fellowship. This is the first Senior AI fellowship and it provides funding for five years. 

The project partners are [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com/),  [Open ML](https://openml.org), [Professor Sylvie Delacroix](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/law/delacroix-sylvie.aspx) and [Data Science Africa](http://datascienceafrica.org).}

\subsection{Inclusive Project}

There is no way that the team we're building will be able to deliver on this agenda alone, so please join us in addressing these challenges!
