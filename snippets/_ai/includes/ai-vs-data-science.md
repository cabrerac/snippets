### Artificial Intelligence

* Principal technology underlying the recent advances in artificial intelligence techniques.

* Different approach to that developed in classical artificial intelligence (sometimes referred to as "good old fashioned AI" or GOFAI).

* GOFAI relied on symbolic logic as its mathematical engine.

### Artificial Intelligence

* Early AI used expert systems: a set of logical rules implemented to reconstruct expertise. For example, rules to decide whether or not someone has cancer.

* Such rules prove hard to specify for very complex processes.[^originai] 

[^originai]: GOFAI has its origins in the birth of computer science so it is unsurprising that logic should be the dominant paradigm. There was also a sense in which pure logic felt like it mapped well on to human reasoning. In practice, for any complex real world situation, the number of logical rules required causes an explosion in the *state space* of the system. This makes logical systems intractable in many applications. 

### Data Science

* Can split applications of machine learning broadly into *data science* and *artificial intelligence*.

* *Data science*: making sense of 'new data', the large volumes of data from sensors and increased interconnectivity (big data, IoT)

* Classical statistics: the question is formed first, and data is later.

### Data Science

* Data Science: data is first, questions come later.

* Overlap through *exploratory data analysis*

### Artificial Intelligence

* *Artificial intelligence* originates in *cybernetics*

* Challenge to recreate 'intelligent' behaviour.

* Either *general intelligence* or emulate *human* capabilities.

* Machine learning is important because of success of data-driven artificial intelligence.

* Data-driven artificial intelligence: instead of solving from first principles, collect data.
