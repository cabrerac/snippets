\subsection{Human Analogue Machine}

\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/ai/human-analogue-machine}{60%}}{The human analogue machine creates a feature space which is analagous to that we use to reason, one way of doing this is to have a machine attempt to compress all human generated text in an auto-regressive manner.}{human-analogue-machine}

\notes{* A human-analogue machine is a machine that has created a feature space that is analagous to the "feature space" our brain uses to reason.

* The latest generation of LLMs are exhibiting this charateristic, giving them ability to converse.}

\newslide{Counterfeit People}

* Perils of this include *counterfeit people*.
* Daniel Dennett has described the challenges these bring in [an article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/).

\newslide{Psychological Representation of the Machine}

* But if correctly done, the machine can be appropriately "psychologically represented"

* This might allow us to deal with the challenge of *intellectual debt* where we create machines we cannot explain.
