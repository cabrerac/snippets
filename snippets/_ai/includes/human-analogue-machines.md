\subsection{Human Analogue Machine}

\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/ai/human-analogue-machine}{60%}}{The human analogue machine creates a feature space which is analagous to that we use to reason, one way of doing this is to have a machine attempt to compress all human generated text in an auto-regressive manner.}{human-analogue-machine}

\notes{* A human-analogue machine is a machine that has created a feature space that is analagous to the "feature space" our brain uses to reason.

* The latest generation of LLMs are exhibiting this charateristic, giving them ability to converse.}

\newslide{Counterfeit People}

* Perils of this include *counterfeit people*.
* Daniel Dennett has described the challenges these bring in [an article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/).

\newslide{Psychological Representation of the Machine}

* But if correctly done, the machine can be appropriately "psychologically represented"

* This might allow us to deal with the challenge of *intellectual debt* where we create machines we cannot explain.

The communication channel between computer and data now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction of information flow, information is reaching us mediated by the computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the machine.}{new-flow-of-information-4}
