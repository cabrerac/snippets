\notes{[Fritz Heider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Heider) and [Marianne Simmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Simmel)'s experiments with animated shapes from 1944 [@Heider:experimental44]. Our interpretation of these objects as showing motives and even emotion is a combination of our desire for narrative, a need for understanding of each other, and our ability to empathise. At one level, these are crudely drawn objects, but in another key way, the animator has communicated a story through simple facets such as their relative motions, their sizes and their actions. We apply our psychological representations to these faceless shapes in an effort to interpret their actions.}
