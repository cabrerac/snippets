\subsection{Five AI Myths}

1. AI will be the first wave of automation that adapts to us.
2. There is value locked into data which is thoughtlessly collected.
3. The big tech companies have the landscape all 'sewn up'
4. There is a new emergent class of 'data scientist' that will solve all problems.
5. The normal rules of business don't apply to AI.
