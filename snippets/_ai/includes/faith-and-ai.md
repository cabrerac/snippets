### Singulariansm: AI as Cartoon Religion

\notes{The first parallels one can find between artificial intelligence and religion come in somewhat of a cartoon doomsday scenario form. The publically hyped fears of superintelligence and singularity can equally be placed within the framework of the simpler questions that religion can try to answer. The parallels are}

1. Superintelligence as god
2. Demi-god status achievable through transhumanism
3. Immortality through uploading the connectome 
4. The day of judgement as the "singularity"

\notes{The notion of a ultra-intelligence is similar to the notion of an interventionist god, with omniscience in the past, present and the future. This notion was described by Pierre Simon Laplace.}

### Singularians

\notes{The notion of Superintelligence in Nick Bostrom's book is that of an infallible omniscience. The challenge of superintelligence according to Bostrom is constraining the power of such an entity. In practice, the premise is based on the Laplace's straw man. No such intelligence could exist due to our ignorance, in practice any real intelligence must express *doubt*. 

Elon Musk has proposed that the only way to defeat the inevitable omniscience would be to augment ourselves with machine like capabilities. Ray Kurzweil has pushed the notion of developing ourselves by augmenting our existing cortex with direct connection to the internet. 

Within Sillicon Valley there is a particular obsession with 'uploading', once the brain is connected, we can achieve immortality by continuing to exist digitally in an artificial environment of our own creation while our physical body is left behind us. 

In this scenario, doomsday is the 'technological singularity', the moment at which computers rapidly outstrip our capabilities and take over our world. The high priests are the scientists, and the aim is to bring about the latter while restraining the former.}

*Singularism* is to religion what *scientology* is to science. Scientology is religion expressing itself as science and Singularism is science expressing itself as religion.

### Artificial Intelligence and Introspection

\slides{
* Religion at it's most powerful contextualizes us
* Creating artificial systems described as intelligence also contextualises us
}
\notes{Ignoring the cartoon view of religion we've outlined above and focussing more on how religion can bring strength to people in their day-to-day living, religious environments bring a place to self reflect and meditate on our existence, and the wider cosmos. How are we here? What is our role? What makes us different. 

Creating machine intelligences characterizes the manner in which we are different, helps us understand what is special about us rather than the machine. 

I have in the past argued strongly against the term artificial
