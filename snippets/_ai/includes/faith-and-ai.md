\subsection{Faith and AI}

\notes{There would seem to be at least three ways in which artificial intelligence and religion interconnect.}

1. Artificial Intelligence as Cartoon Religion
2. Artificial Intelligence and Introspection
3. Independence of thought and Control: A Systemic Catch 22

\subsection{Singularianism: AI as Cartoon Religion}

\notes{The first parallels one can find between artificial intelligence and religion come in somewhat of a cartoon doomsday scenario form. The publically hyped fears of superintelligence and singularity can equally be placed within the framework of the simpler questions that religion can try to answer. The parallels are}

1. Superintelligence as god
2. Demi-god status achievable through transhumanism
3. Immortality through uploading the connectome 
4. The day of judgement as the "singularity"

\notes{Ultraintelligence [@Good:ultraintelligent66] is similar to the notion of an interventionist god, with omniscience in the past, present and the future. This notion was described by Pierre Simon Laplace.}
