### Singulariansm: AI as Cartoon Religion

\notes{The first parallels one can find between artificial intelligence and religion come in somewhat of a cartoon doomsday scenario form. The publically hyped fears of superintelligence and singularity can equally be placed within the framework of the simpler questions that religion can try to answer. The parallels are}

1. Superintelligence as god
2. Demi-god status achievable through transhumanism
3. Immortality through uploading the connectome 
4. The day of judgement as the "singularity"

\notes{The notion of a ultra-intelligence is similar to the notion of an interventionist god, with omniscience in the past, present and the future. This notion was described by Pierre Simon Laplace.}

### Singularians

\notes{The notion of Superintelligence in Nick Bostrom's book is that of an infallible omniscience. The challenge of superintelligence according to Bostrom is constraining the power of such an entity. In practice, the premise is based on the Laplace's straw man. No such intelligence could exist due to our ignorance, in practice any real intelligence must express *doubt*. 

Elon Musk has proposed that the only way to defeat the inevitable omniscience would be to augment ourselves with machine like capabilities. Ray Kurzweil has pushed the notion of developing ourselves by augmenting our existing cortex with direct connection to the internet. 

Within Sillicon Valley there is a particular obsession with 'uploading', once the brain is connected, we can achieve immortality by continuing to exist digitally in an artificial environment of our own creation while our physical body is left behind us. 

In this scenario, doomsday is the 'technological singularity', the moment at which computers rapidly outstrip our capabilities and take over our world. The high priests are the scientists, and the aim is to bring about the latter while restraining the former.}

*Singularism* is to religion what *scientology* is to science. Scientology is religion expressing itself as science and Singularism is science expressing itself as religion.

### Artificial Intelligence and Introspection

\slides{
* Religion at it's most powerful contextualizes us
* Creating artificial systems described as intelligence also contextualises us
* Artificial Plants

\notes{Ignoring the cartoon view of religion we've outlined above and focussing more on how religion can bring strength to people in their day-to-day living, religious environments bring a place to self reflect and meditate on our existence, and the wider cosmos. How are we here? What is our role? What makes us different? 

Creating machine intelligences characterizes the manner in which we are different, helps us understand what is special about us rather than the machine. 

I have in the past argued strongly against the term artificial intelligence but there is a sense in which it is a good term. If we think of artificial plants, then we have the right sense in which we are creating an artificial intelligence. An artificial plant is fundamentally different from a real plant, but can appear similar, or from a distance identical. However, a creator of an artificial plant gains a greater appreciation for the complexity of a natural plant. 

In a similar way, we might expect that attempts to emulate human intelligence would lead to a deeper appreciation of that intelligence. This type of reflection on who we are has a lot in common with many of the (to me) most endearing characteristics of religion.}

### The Cosmic Catch 22

* A return to Eden?
  * Big Mother 
  * Big Brother

\notes{A final parallel between the world of AI and that of religion is the conundrums they raise for us. In particular the tradeoffs between a paternalistic society and individual freedoms. Two models for artificial intelligence that may be realistic are the "big brother" and the "big mother" models. The former refers to the surveillance society and the control of populations that can be achieved with a greater understanding of the individual self. A perceptual understanding of the individual that conceivably be of better than the individual's self perception. The same understanding of individual is also necessary for the "big mother" scenario, where intelligent agents provide for us in the manner in which our parents did for us when we were young. Both scenarios are disempowering in terms of individual liberties. In a metaphorical sense, this could be seen as a return to Eden, a surrendering of individual liberties for a perceived paradise. But those individual liberties are also what we value. There is a tension between a desire to create the perfect environment, where no evil exists and our individual liberty. Our society chooses a balance between the pros and cons that attempts to sustain a diversity of perspectives and beliefs. Even if it were possible to use AI to organzie society in such a way that particular malevolent behaviours were prevented, doing so may come at the cost of the individual freedom we enjoy. These are difficult trade offs, and the exist both when explaining the nature of religious belief and when considering the nature of either the dystopian big brother or the "dys-utopian" big mother view of AI.}
