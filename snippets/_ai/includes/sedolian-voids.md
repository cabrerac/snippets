\speakernotes{Sedolian void: Despite the many millions of matches that AlphaGo had played, Lee Sedol
managed to find a board position that was distinct from anything AlphaGo
had seen before. Within the high dimensional pinball machine that made
up AlphaGo's decision making systems, Lee Sedol found a niche, an
Achillean chink in AlphaGo's armour. He found a path through the neural
network where no data had every been before. He found a location in
feature space where there be dragons.}
