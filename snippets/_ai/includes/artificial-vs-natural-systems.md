\subsection{Artificial vs Natural Systems}
\slides{
* Consider natural intelligence, or natural *systems*
* Contrast between an artificial *system* and an natural system.
* The key difference between the two is that artificial systems are *designed* whereas natural systems are *evolved*.

\notes{Darwin never said "Survival of the Fittest" he talked about evolution by natural selection.

Evolution is better described as "non-survival of the non-fit". You don't have to be the fittest to survive, you just need to avoid the pitfalls of life. This is the first priority.}

\newslide{Mistake we Make}
\slides{
* Equate fitness for objective function.
* Assume static environment and known objective. 
}

\notes{A mistake we make in the design of our systems is to equate fitness with the objective function, and to assume it is known and static. In practice, a real environment would have an evolving fitness function which would be unknown at any given time.}
