\subsection{What is Intelligence?}
\slides{
* Poorly defined.
    * My definition: use of information to achieve goals more efficiently.
	* Efficiency is defined through use of less resource.
* Automated decision making: we are continuing to progress well.

\newslide{The Silicon Factor}
\slides{
* BBC 1, London, 14th September 1980
* [Series of three programmes](http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/8bb0b5a05c38403280483e2f96aff1b9) investigating the so-called microelectronics revolution.
* The promise (and perils) of silicon was broadly similar to that for AI today.

\newslide{Public Definition}
\slides{
* Doing things that humans do.
    * There is a narcissistic element to our understanding of *artificial intelligence*
* It's a shifting definition.
    * Intelligence is the stuff I can do computers can't.
}

\notes{A more recent example comes from the middle of the last century. A hundred years ago *computers* were human beings, often female, who conducted repetitive mathematical tasks for the creation of mathematical tables such as logarithms. Our modern digital computers were originally called *automatic computers* to reflect the fact that the intelligence of these human operators had been automated. But despite the efficiency with which they perform these tasks, very few think of their mobile phones or computers as intelligent.}



\newslide{Cybernetics and the Ratio Club}
\slides{
* Cybernetics: Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine by [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener) (1948)
* [Ratio Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Club) members include [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), [Jack Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good), [Horace Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Barlow), [Donald MacKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_MacCrimmon_MacKay)
}
\notes{Norbert Wiener launched last century’s first wave of interest in emulation of intelligence with his book “Cybernetics”. The great modern success that stemmed from that work is the modern engineering discipline of Automatic Control. The technology that allows fighter jets to fly. These ideas came out of the Second World War, when researchers explored the use of radar (automated sensing) and automatic computation for decryption of military codes (automated decision making). Post war a body of researchers, including Alan Turing, were seeing the potential for electronic emulation of what had up until then been the preserve of an animallian nervous system.}

\notes{Artificial intelligence is a badly defined term. Successful deployments of intelligent systems are common, but normally they are redefined to be non-intelligent. My favourite example is [the Centrifugal governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor). Applied to the Steam Engine by Boulton and Watt and immortalised in the arms of the statue of “Science” on the Holborn viaduct in London, the centrifugal governor automatically regulated the speed of a steam engine, closing the inlet valve progressively as the engine ran faster. It did the job that an intelligent operator used to have to do, but few today would describe it as “artificial intelligence”.}
