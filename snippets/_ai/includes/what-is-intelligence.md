\subsection{What is Intelligence?}
\slides{
* Poorly defined.
    * My definition: use of information to achieve goals more efficiently.
	* Efficiency is defined through use of less resource.
* Automated decision making: we are continuing to progress well.
}

\notes{One challenge with the word intelligence is it means many different things to different people. My own definition of intelligence is the use of information to achieve goals more efficiently. Where information is measured in Shannon terms, and efficiency is measured in terms of use of resource, typically available energy or maybe time. The definition appeals to me because it brings about a connection between the major historic revolutions, which have been about energy, and the current changes which focus more on information. However, the definition does not specify the goal. Some prefer to try and incorporate the goal in their definition of intelligence, and that goals should be somehow emergent from intelligence. For complex tasks sub-goals are certainly emergent, but I don't seek to incorporate a global goal in my own definition.}

\newslide{The Silicon Factor}
\slides{
* BBC 1, London, 14th September 1980
* [Series of three programmes](http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/8bb0b5a05c38403280483e2f96aff1b9) investigating the so-called microelectronics revolution.
* The promise (and perils) of silicon was broadly similar to that for AI today.

\notes{So where are we in terms of intelligence? There is certainly an information revolution going on, and it is causing disruption across many industries. But what we are saying about machine learning and artificial inteligence has been said before in relation to the invention of sillicon chips. I gave a version of this talk once at the BBC, and Bill Thompson was kind enough to share with me the archive of "Silicon Factor", a series of three programs broadcast in 1980 exploring the "microelectronics revolution". There is a remarkable similarity to everything the experts say in these programs and what experts say about AI today. And of course, these experts were right, jobs have changed, industry is different and we are still deep in the micro-electronics revolution. However, these changes do not happen overnight, those broadcasts were made nearly forty years ago. The "Fourth Industrial Revolution" is merely a continuation of an ongoing revolution in information, one which was triggered by the Silicon Factor, continued by the internet and has been given further momentum by mobile communications.}


\newslide{Public Definition}
\slides{
* Doing things that humans do.
    * There is a narcissistic element to our understanding of *artificial intelligence*
* It's a shifting definition.
    * Intelligence is the stuff I can do computers can't.
}

\notes{With a word like intelligence, we can't just think about our own definition of intelligence, but we should also take into account public understanding of the world. For many people intelligence is something specific to humans, and as a result what the term refers to evolves. Artificial intelligence is a very emotive term, because it feels close to us, it makes us think that computers are doing things like us. As a result it is also a shifting definition, it comes to me "intelligence is the stuff I can do that computers can't". This lends a narcissistic element to our fascination with artificial intelligence, because it is also a fascination with ourselves.}

\notes{A hundred years ago *computers* were human beings, often female, who conducted repetitive mathematical tasks for the creation of mathematical tables such as logarithms. Our modern digital computers were originally called *automatic computers* to reflect the fact that the intelligence of these human operators had been automated. But despite the efficiency with which they perform these tasks, very few think of their mobile phones or computers as intelligent.}

\newslide{Cybernetics and the Ratio Club}
\slides{
* Cybernetics: Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine by [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener) (1948)
* [Ratio Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Club) members include [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), [Jack Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good), [Horace Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Barlow), [Donald MacKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_MacCrimmon_MacKay)
}
\notes{Norbert Wiener launched last century’s first wave of interest in emulation of intelligence with his book “Cybernetics”. The great modern success that stemmed from that work is the modern engineering discipline of Automatic Control. The technology that allows fighter jets to fly. These ideas came out of the Second World War, when researchers explored the use of radar (automated sensing) and automatic computation for decryption of military codes (automated decision making). Post war a body of researchers, including Alan Turing, were seeing the potential for electronic emulation of what had up until then been the preserve of an animallian nervous system.}

\notes{Artificial intelligence is a badly defined term. Successful deployments of intelligent systems are common, but normally they are redefined to be non-intelligent. My favourite example is [the Centrifugal governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor). Applied to the Steam Engine by Boulton and Watt and immortalised in the arms of the statue of “Science” on the Holborn viaduct in London, the centrifugal governor automatically regulated the speed of a steam engine, closing the inlet valve progressively as the engine ran faster. It did the job that an intelligent operator used to have to do, but few today would describe it as “artificial intelligence”.}
