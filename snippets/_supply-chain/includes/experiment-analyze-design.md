\newslide{Our Vision}

> We don't know what science we'll want to do in 5 years time, but we won't want slower experiments, we won't want more expensive experiments and we won't want a narrower selection of experiments.

\newslide{What do we want?}

* Faster, cheaper and more diverse experiments.

\newslide{Our Objective}

> A two order of magnitude increase in number of experiments run on supply chain three years' time.
