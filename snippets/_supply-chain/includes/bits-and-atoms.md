\section{The Physical World: Where Bits meet Atoms}

\notes{Before I joined Amazon I was invited to speak at their annual Machine Learning Conference. It has over two thousand attendees. I met the Vice President in charge of Amazon Special Projects, Babak Parviz. He said to me, the important thing about Amazon is that it's a "bits and atoms" company, meaning it moves both stuff (atoms) and information (bits). This quote resonated with me because it maps well on to my own definition of intelligence. Moving stuff requires resource. Moving, or processing, of information to move stuff more efficiently requires intelligence. 

That notion is the most fundamental notion for how the modern information infrastructure can help society. At Amazon the place where bits meet atoms is the *supply chain*. The movement of goods from manufacturer to customer, the supply chain.}

* Moving goods to where they need to be.
  * Raw materials

\notes{[Cromford Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Mill) was Richard Arkwright's first water powered cotton spinning mill. The mill was built at [Cromford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford) in 1771 to supply the Nottingham weavers. 

The raw material for the mill, the wool, arrived at Manchester, across the Pennines.

Arkwright chose this location due to the availability of water power from the River Derwent. But in terms of transport connections, there were very few. 

By 1794 the [Cromford Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Canal) was completed giving access to Nottingham.

The A6 now does pass through Cromford, but at the time he moved there there was merely a track.

The High Peak Railway was opened in 1832, it is now converted to the High Peak Trail, but it remains the highest railway built in Britain.

\newslide{Supply and Demand: Physical Infrastructure}

* The Supply Chain is driven by Supply and Demand

* Moving goods to be where they should be at any given time.

\newslide{Information Infrastructure}

* Recent advances in the world have focussed on *information infrastructure*.

* UK developed with roads, rails and canals
