\notes{[Cromford Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Mill) was Richard Arkwright's first water powered cotton spinning mill. The mill was built at [Cromford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford) in 1771 to supply the Nottingham weavers. 

The raw material for the mill, the wool, arrived at Manchester, across the Pennines.

Arkwright chose this location due to the availability of water power from the River Derwent. But in terms of transport connections, there were very few. 

By 1794 the [Cromford Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Canal) was completed giving access to Nottingham.

The A6 now does pass through Cromford, but at the time he moved there there was merely a track.

The High Peak Railway was opened in 1832, it is now converted to the High Peak Trail, but it remains the highest railway built in Britain.
