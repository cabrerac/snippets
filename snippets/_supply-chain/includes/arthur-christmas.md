Truth is almost as strange as fiction, Amazon has over half a million employees, and drones aren't yet approved for more than test flights.}{arthur-christmas}

\notes{I think the best way of describing what my role at Amazon was is by referring to the film "Arthur Christmas". In the film, the reality of what delivering presents to all the children in the world in one night is portrayed. Doing that job is what Amazon's supply chain is designed for.

Of course, gift giving occurs at different times in different cultures, internally it would be referred to as 'peak', but the machine of Amazon is prediciting what people want, where they want it and how to get it there.}

\notes{In Arthur Christmas the entire operation was run from a flying ship for present delivery, of course, that's a little ridiculous. The truth is that Amazon wants to use lots of little ships, or drones, and the team had the pleasure of working on developing those too.}
