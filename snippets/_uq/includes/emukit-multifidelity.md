\section{An Introduction to Multi-fidelity Modeling in Emukit}

\subsection{Overview}

\notes{This section is based on the [Emukit multifidelity tutorial found here](https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/blob/master/notebooks/Emukit-tutorial-multi-fidelity-bayesian-optimization.ipynb) and written by Javier Gonzalez, Mark Pullin, Oleg Ponomarev and David-Elias KÃ¼nstle.}

\notes{A common issue encountered when applying machine learning to environmental sciences and engineering problems is the difficulty or cost required to obtain sufficient data for building robust models.
Possible examples include aerospace and nautical engineering, where it is both infeasible and prohibitively expensive to run a vast number of experiments using the actual vehicle.
Even when there is no physical artifact involved, such as in climate modeling, data may still be hard to obtain when these can only be collected by running an expensive computer experiment, where the time required to acquire an individual data sample restricts the volume of data that can later be used for modeling.

Constructing a reliable model when only few observations are available is challenging, which is why it is common practice to develop *simulators* of the actual system, from which data points can be more easily obtained.
In engineering applications, such simulators often take the form of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools which approximate the behaviour of the true artifact for a given design or configuration.
However, although it is now possible to obtain more data samples, it is highly unlikely that these simulators model the true system exactly; instead, these are expected to contain some degree of bias and/or noise.}

\notes{From the above, one can deduce that naively combining observations from multiple information sources could result in the model giving biased predictions which do not accurately reflect the true problem.
To this end, *multi-fidelity models* are designed to augment the limited true observations available with cheaply-obtained approximations in a principled manner.
In such models, observations obtained from the true source are referred to as *high-fidelity* observations, whereas approximations are denoted as being *low-fidelity*.
These low-fidelity observations are then systemically combined with the more accurate (but limited) observations in order to predict the high-fidelity output more effectively.
Note than we can generally combine information from multiple lower fidelity sources, which can all be seen as auxiliary tasks in support of a single primary task.}

\notes{In this notebook, we shall investigate a selection of multi-fidelity models based on Gaussian processes which are readily available in `Emukit`.
We  start by investigating the traditional linear multi-fidelity model as proposed in [@Kennedy-predicting00].
Subsequently, we shall illustrate why this model can be unsuitable when the mapping from low to high-fidelity observations is nonlinear, and demonstrate how an alternate model proposed in @Pedikaris:nonlinear17 can alleviate this issue.
The examples presented in this notebook can then be easily adapted to a variety of problem settings.}

\subsection{Linear multi-fidelity model}

\notes{The linear multi-fidelity model proposed in [[Kennedy and O'Hagan, 2000]](#3.-References) is widely viewed as a reference point for all such models.
In this model, the high-fidelity (true) function is modeled as a scaled sum of the low-fidelity function plus an error term:}
$$
\mappingFunction_{\text{high}}(x) = \mappingFunction_{\text{err}}(x) + \rho \,\mappingFunction_{\text{low}}(x)
$$
\notes{In this equation, $\mappingFunction_{\text{low}}(x)$ is taken to be a Gaussian process modeling the outputs of the lower fidelity function, while $\rho$ is a scaling factor indicating the magnitude of the correlation to the high-fidelity data.
Setting this to 0 implies that there is no correlation between observations at different fidelities.
Meanwhile, $\mappingFunction_{\text{err}}(x)$ denotes yet another Gaussian process which models the bias term for the high-fidelity data.
Note that $\mappingFunction_{\text{err}}(x)$ and $\mappingFunction_{\text{low}}(x)$ are assumed to be independent processes which are only related by the equation given above.}

\notes{**Note**: While we shall limit our explanation to the case of two fidelities, this set-up can easily be generalized to cater for $T$ fidelities as follows:}
$$
\mappingFunction_{t}(x) = \mappingFunction_{t}(x) + \rho_{t-1} \,\mappingFunction_{t-1}(x), \quad t=1,\dots, T
$$
\notes{If the training points are sorted such that the low and high-fidelity points are grouped together:}
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\inputMatrix_{\text{low}} \\
\inputMatrix_{\text{high}}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\notes{we can express the model as a single Gaussian process having the following prior.}
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mappingFunction_{\text{low}}\left(h\right)\\
\mappingFunction_{\text{high}}\left(h\right)
\end{bmatrix}
\sim
GP
\begin{pmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
\kernelScalar_{\text{low}} & \rho \kernelScalar_{\text{low}} \\
\rho \kernelScalar_{\text{low}} & \rho^2 \kernelScalar_{\text{low}} + \kernelScalar_{\text{err}}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\subsubsection{Linear multi-fidelity modeling in Emukit}

\notes{As a first example of how the linear multi-fidelity model implemented in `Emukit` `emukit.multi_fidelity.models.GPyLinearMultiFidelityModel` can be used, we shall consider the two-fidelity Forrester function.
This benchmark is frequently used to illustrate the capabilities of multi-fidelity models.}

\notes{The inputs to the models are expected to take the form of ndarrays where the last column indicates the fidelity of the observed points.}

\notes{Although only the input points, $X$, are augmented with the fidelity level, the observed outputs $Y$ must also be converted to array form.}

\notes{For example, a dataset consisting of 3 low-fidelity points and 2 high-fidelity points would be represented as follows, where the input is three-dimensional while the output is one-dimensional:}
$$
\inputMatrix = \begin{pmatrix}
\inputScalar_{\text{low};0}^0 & \inputScalar_{\text{low};0}^1 & \inputScalar_{\text{low};0}^2 & 0\\
\inputScalar_{\text{low};1}^0 & \inputScalar_{\text{low};1}^1 & \inputScalar_{\text{low};1}^2 & 0\\

\notes{Observe that in the example above we restrict our observations to 12 from the lower fidelity function and only 6 from the high fidelity function.
As we shall demonstrate further below, fitting a standard GP model to the few high fidelity observations is unlikely to result in an acceptable fit, which is why we shall instead consider the linear multi-fidelity model presented in this section.}

\notes{Below we fit a linear multi-fidelity model to the available low and high fidelity observations. Given the smoothness of the functions, we opt to use an *RBF* kernel for both the bias and correlation components of the model.}

\notes{**Note**: The model implementation defaults to a `MixedNoise` noise likelihood whereby there is independent Gaussian noise for each fidelity.

This can be modified upfront using the 'likelihood' parameter in the model constructor, or by updating them directly after the model has been created.
In the example below, we choose to fix the noise to '0' for both fidelities in order to reflect that the observations are exact.}

\notes{As expected, the linear multi-fidelity model was unable to capture the nonlinear relationship between the low and high-fidelity data.
Consequently, the resulting fit of the true function is also poor.}

\subsubsection{Nonlinear Multi-fidelity model}

\notes{In view of the deficiencies of the linear multi-fidelity model, a nonlinear multi-fidelity model is proposed in @Pedikaris:nonlinear17 in order to better capture these correlations.
This nonlinear model is constructed as follows:}
$$ 
\mappingFunction_{\text{high}}(x) = \rho( \, \mappingFunction_{\text{low}}(x)) + \delta(x) 
$$

\notes{Replacing the linear scaling factor with a non-deterministic function results in a model which can thus capture the nonlinear relationship between the fidelities.}

\notes{This model is implemented in Emukit as `emukit.multi_fidelity.models.NonLinearModel`.}

\notes{It is defined in a sequential manner where a Gaussian process model is trained for every set of fidelity data available. Once again, we manually fix the noise parameter for each model to 0. The parameters of the two Gaussian processes are then optimized sequentially, starting from the low-fidelity.}
