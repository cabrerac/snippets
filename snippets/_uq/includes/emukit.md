\notes{
* *Multi-fidelity emulation*: build surrogate models when data is obtained from multiple information sources that have different fidelity and/or cost;
* *Bayesian optimisation*: optimise physical experiments and tune parameters of machine learning algorithms;
* *Experimental design/Active learning*: design the most informative experiments and perform active learning with machine learning models;
* *Sensitivity analysis*: analyse the influence of inputs on the outputs of a given system;
* *Bayesian quadrature*: efficiently compute the integrals of functions that are expensive to evaluate.
