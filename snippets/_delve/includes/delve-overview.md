\notes{Any policy question can be framed in a number of different
ways - what are the health outcomes; what is the impact on NHS
capacity; how are different groups affected; what is the economic
impact – and each has different types of evidence associated with
it. Complex and uncertain challenges require efforts to draw insights
together from across disciplines.}

\notes{Sustained engagement between government and academia plays an
important role in building mutual understanding about what each can
deliver. Core to Delve’s work was the intention that research
questions be framed in ways that would resonate with the policy
challenges being seen in government.}
