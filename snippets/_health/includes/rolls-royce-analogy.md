### Understanding Patient Data

\notes{We know from the Wellcome report by Nicola Perrin et al on "Understanding Patient Data" that patients trust Universities and hospitals more than the trust commercial entities and insurers.}

### WannaCry

\notes{But there are challenges for public bodies in terms of maintaining the security of data. For example, the recent WannaCry virus attack which demonstrated the unpreparedness of much of the NHS IT infrastructure for a virus exhibiting an exploit that was well known to the security community. The key point is that the public trust the *intent* of academics and medical professionals, but actual *capability* is at variance with the intent.} 

### Bush Pilot Model

\notes{The situation is somewhat reminiscient of early aviation, and the nature of the job of *bush pilots*, who fly to remote places and often have mechanical skills required to fix the plane. Bush planes are also capable of making rough landings on harsh terrain. To a passenger, the sight of this pilot changing the oil before a flight out from a remote spot in the bush is likely reassuring.}

* The difference between *capability* and *intent*.

\notes{But I suspect most passengers would find it disconcerting if the pilot of a 747 was seen working on the engine shortly before a flight. As aviation has become more widespread, there is now a separation of responsibilities between pilots and mechanics. Indeed, Rolls Royce maintain ownership of their engines today, and merely lease them to the aircraft company. The responsibility for maintenance of the engine is entirely with Rolls Royce, yet the pilot is responsibility for the safety of the aircraft and its passengers.

This separation of responsibility according to expertise needs to be emulated when considering health data infrastructure. This resolves the *intent-capability* dilemma, by ensuring a separation of responsibilities to those that are best placed to address the issues.}

\notes{We must also be careful to maintain openness in this new genaration of digital solutions for patient care. Matthew Syed's book, "Black Box Thinking", emphasizes the importance of errors as a route to learning and improved process. Taking aviation as an example, and contrasting it with the culture in medicine, Matthew relates the story of [Martin Bromiley](https://chfg.org/trustees/martin-bromiley/), an airline pilot whose wife died during a routine hospital procedure and his efforts to improve the culture of safety in medicine. The motivation for the book is the difference in culture between aviation and medicine in how errors are acknowledged and dealt with. We must ensure that these high standards of oversight apply to the era of data-driven automated decision making.}
