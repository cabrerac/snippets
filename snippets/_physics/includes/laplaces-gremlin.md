\subsection{Laplace's Gremlin}

\notes{The real point of Laplace's essay was that we don't have access to all the data, we don't have access to a complete physical understanding, and as the example of the Game of Life shows, even if we did have access to both of these (as we do for "Conway's universe") we still don't have access to all the compute that we need to make deterministic predictions. There is uncertainty in the system which means we can't make precise predictions.}

\notes{I like to call this "Laplace's Gremlin". Gremlins are imaginary creatures used as an explaination of failure in aircraft, causing crashes. In that sense the Gremlin represents the uncertainty that a pilot felt about what might go wrong in a plane which might be "theoretically sound" but in practice is poorly maintained or exposed to conditions that take it beyond its design criteria. Laplace's gremlin is all the things that your model, data and ability to compute don't account for bringing about failures in your ability to predict. Laplace's Gremlin is the uncertainty in the system.}
