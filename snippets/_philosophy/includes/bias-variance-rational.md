\subsection{Rational Behaviour}

* Sustain a variety of approaches to life.
* Complex explanations such as half-time football punditry.
* Also clinical experts [@Meehl-clinicalstatistical54]. Meehl suggested they 'try to be clever and think outside the box'. 


\subsection{One Correct Solution}

* Artificial Selection and Eugenics.
* OK for race horses, greyhounds, crops, sheep and cows 
* Not OK for the human race.


\subsection{One Correct Solution}

* Flawed understanding of science
* Animals in a species become too specialised then they may not be able to respond to changing circumstances. 
    * Think of cheetahs and eagles vs rats and pigeons.


\subsection{Similar Ideas Socially}

> I may not agree with many people's subjective approach to life, I may even believe it to be severely sub-optimal. But I should not presume to know better, even if prior experience shows that my own 'way of being' is effective. 
>
> Variation is vitally important for robustness. There may be future circumstances where my approaches fail utterly, and other ways of being are better.


\subsection{A Universal Utility}

* Quality of our individual subjective utilities measured by effectiveness.
* But it is survival of entire species that dominates long term.
* A universal utility by which we are judged is difficult to define.


\subsection{The Real Ethical Dilemma}

* Trolley Problem is an oversimplification.
* Driverless cars: 
    * introduce driverless cars and bring about a 90% reduction in deaths 
	* What if remaining deaths are all cyclists?
