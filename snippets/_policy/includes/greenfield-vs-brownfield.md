\subsection{Greenfield vs Brownfield}

\notes{Stepping back from the pure government context, we can ask "what are the greatest opportunities for the UK in enabling data-driven innovation?" When answering this, I like to separate “greenfield” innovation and “brownfield” innovation. Both are important, but are different in character.}

\notes{*Greenfield innovation*: a previous example of greenfield innovation is the the computer games industry. in the early days of software. A new form of business and company that capitalized on new technology to create new businesses.}

\notes{In the 1980's Robert Solow said: I see computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics. This is the challenge of *brownfield innovation*, retrofitting the technology into existing businesses. For example. the process of digital transformation is still not complete in supply chain (my team at Amazon focussed on delivering machine learning technology in that domain).}

\notes{There is a massive opportunity for the UK in *brownfield innovation*, but it's easier to talk about greenfield innovation (e.g. how Google does things) regardless of whether those ideas transfer to the institutional characters that we're looking to form.}

\notes{The key challenge/opportunity in data driven decision making is bridging the gap. Overall we require an ecosystem of companies that deliver greenfield innovators that address the challenges of the brownfield domains. We can't afford for there to be such a large gap between e.g. car parts manufacturing in Rotherham and city trading. A similar story plays out at a smaller scale within government. But I suspect the subtleties of this story can be lost in spending plans. The Data Maturity Assessment gives a route to reviewing the extent to which such plans move beyond "fancy words" and translate into the reality of how decisions are being made in a given department.}
