\subsection{The NeurIPS Experiment}

\notes{The objective of the NeurIPS experiment was to determine how consistent was the process of peer review? What would happen to the papers in the conference if the process was independently rerun?}

\slides{* How consistent was the process of peer review? 
* What would happen if you independently reran it?}

\newslide{The NeurIPS Experiment}

\notes{To explore this question, we selected $\approx 10\%$ of submitted papers to be reviewed twice, by independent committees.}

\notes{We randomly selected 170 papers from the total submitted for this treatment. For these papers the program committee was divided into two. Reviewers were placed randomly on one side of the committee or the other. For Program Chairs we also engaged in some manual selection to ensure we had expert coverage in all the conference areas on both side of the committee.}

\slides{* We selected ~10% of NeurIPS papers to be reviewed twice, independently.
* 170 papers were reviewed by two separate committees.
  * Each committee was 1/2 the size of the full committee.
  * Reviewers allocated at random
  * Area Chairs allocated to ensure distribution of expertise}
