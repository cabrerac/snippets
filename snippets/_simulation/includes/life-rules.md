\subsection{Life Rules}

* **Survival** Every pixel surrounded by two or three other pixels survives for the next turn.
* **Death** Each pixel surrounded by four or more pixels dies from overpopulation. Likewise, every pixel next to one or no pixels at all dies from isolation.
* **Birth** Each square adjacent to exactly three pixels gives birth to a new pixel.
