### What is Machine Learning? {data-transition="none"}

. . .

$$ \text{data} + \text{model} \rightarrow \text{prediction}$$

. . .

-   $\text{data}$ : observations, could be actively or passively
    acquired (meta-data).

. . .

-   $\text{model}$ : assumptions, based on previous experience (other data!
    transfer learning etc), or beliefs about the regularities of
    the universe. Inductive bias.

. . .

-   $\text{prediction}$ : an action to be taken or a categorization or a
    quality score.
