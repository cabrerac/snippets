consumbable. The data crisis can only be addressed if we focus on
outputs rather than inputs.}}

\notes{\caption{For a data first architecture we need to clean our
data at source, rather than individually cleaning data for each
task. This involves a shift of focus from our inputs to our
outputs. We should provide data streams that are consumable by many
teams without purification.}}
}

\recommendation{We need to share best practice around data deployment across our teams. We should make best use of our processes where applicable, but we need to develop them to become *data first* organizations. Data needs to be cleaned at *output* not at *input*.}
