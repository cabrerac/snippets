### Data Driven

* Machine Learning: Replicate Processes through *direct use of data*.

* Aim to emulate cognitive processes through the use of data.

* Use data to provide new approaches in control and optimization that should allow for emulation of human motor skills. 

### Process Emulation

* Key idea:  emulate the process as a mathematical function.

* Each function has a set of *parameters* which control its behavior.

* *Learning* is the process of changing these parameters to change the shape of the function

* Choice of which class of mathematical functions we use is a vital component of our *model*.

*Example of prediction: The Olympic gold medalist in the marathon's pace is predicted using a regression fit. In this case the mathematical function is directly predicting the pace of the winner as a function of the year of the Olympics.*
