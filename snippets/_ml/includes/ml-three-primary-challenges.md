\slides{
* Three primary challenges of Machine Learning Systems Design.
1. Decomposition
2. Data 
3. Deployment

\notes{The first two components *decomposition* and *data* are interlinked, but we will first outline the decomposition challenge. Below we will mainly focus on *supervised learning* because this is arguably the technology that is best understood within machine learning.}
