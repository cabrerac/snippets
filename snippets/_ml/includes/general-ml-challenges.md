* Three primary challenges of Machine Learning Systems Design.
1. Design
2. Data 
3. Deployment
}
\notes{We can characterize the challenges for integrating machine learning within our systems as the three Ds. Design, Data and Deployment.}

\notes{The first two components *design* and *data* are interlinked, but we will first outline the design challenge. Below we will mainly focus on *supervised learning* because this is arguably the technology that is best understood within machine learning.}
