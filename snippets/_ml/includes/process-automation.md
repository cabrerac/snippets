### Efficiency

* Economies driven by 'production'.

* Greater production comes with better efficiency.

    * E.g. moving from gathering food to settled agriculture.

* In the modern era one approach to becoming more efficient is automation of processes.

    *  E.g. manufacturing production lines

### Physical Processes

* Manufacturing processes consist of production lines and robotic automation.

* Logistics can also be decomposed into the supply chain processes.

* Efficiency can be improved by automation.

### Goods and Information

* For modern society: management of flow of goods and  information.

* Flow of information is highly automated.

* Processing of data is decomposed into stages in computer code. 

### Intervention

* For all cases:  manufacturing, logistics, data management

* Pipeline requires human intervention from an operator.

* Interventions create bottlenecks, slow the process.

* Machine learning is a key technology in automating these manual stages.

### Long Grass

* Easy to replicate interventions have already been dealt with.

* Components that still require human intervention are the knottier problems.

* Difficult decompose into stages which could then be further automated.

* These components are 'process-atoms'.

* These are the "long grass" regions of technology.

### Nature of Challenge

*  In manufacturing or logistics settings atoms are flexible manual skills.

    * Requires emulation of a human's motor skills.

* In information processing: our flexible cognitive skills.

    * Our ability to mentally process an image or some text. 

### Worked Example: Delivery Drones
