### What does Machine Learning do?

* We scale by codifying processes and automating them.

    * Ensure components are compatible (Whitworth threads)

    * Then interconnect them as efficiently as possible.

### Codify Through Mathematical Functions 

* How does machine learning work?

* Jumper (jersey/sweater) purchase with logistic regression

$$ \text{odds} = \frac{\text{bought}}{\text{not bought}} $$

$$ \log \text{odds}  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age} + \beta_2 \text{latitude}$$
