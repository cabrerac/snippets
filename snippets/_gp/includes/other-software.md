\subsection{Other Software}

\notes{GPy has inspired other software solutions, first of all [GPflow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow), which uses Tensor Flow's automatic differentiation engine to allow rapid prototyping of new covariance functions and algorithms. More recently, [GPyTorch](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch) uses PyTorch for the same purpose.

GPy itself is being restructured with MXFusion as its computational engine to give similiar capabilities.}
