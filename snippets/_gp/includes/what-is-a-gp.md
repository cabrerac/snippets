### Artificial Intelligence

* Machine learning is a mainstay because of importance of prediction.

### What is Machine Learning?

* Simple description

    $$\text{data} + \text{model} \rightarrow \text{prediction}$$

* To combine data with a model need:

    * **a prediction function** $\mappingFunction(\cdot)$ includes our beliefs about the regularities of the universe

    * **an objective function** $\errorFunction(\cdot)$ defines the cost of misprediction.


### Uncertainty

* Uncertainty in prediction arises from:

    1. scarcity of training data and 
    2. mismatch between the set of prediction functions we choose and all possible prediction functions.

* Also uncertainties in objective, leave those for another day.

### Olympic Marathon Data

<table>
<tr><td>
-   Gold medal times for Olympic Marathon since 1896.

-   Marathons before 1924 didnâ€™t have a standardised distance.

-   Present results using pace per km.

-   In 1904 Marathon was badly organised leading to very slow times.
