\newslide{GPy: A Gaussian Process Framework in Python}

* BSD Licensed software base.
* Wide availability of libraries, ``modern'' scripting language.
* Allows us to set projects to undergraduates in Comp Sci that use GPs.
* Available through GitHub
  \url{https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy}
* Reproducible Research with IPython Notebook.


\newslide{Features, Present and Imminent}

* Non-Gaussian likelihoods.
* Multivariate outputs.
* Dimensionality reduction.
* Approximations for large data sets.
* Probabilistic-style programming (specify the model, not the algorithm).
* A range of covariance functions, ability to implement your own symbolically.
* Data missing at random.
