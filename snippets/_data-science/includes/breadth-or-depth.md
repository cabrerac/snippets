### Breadth vs Depth Paradox

* Able to quantify to a greater and greater degree the actions of individuals

* But less able to characterize society

* As we measure more, we understand less

### What?

* Perhaps greater preponderance of data is making society itself more complex

* Therefore traditional approaches to measurement are failing

* Curate's egg of a society: it is only 'measured in parts'

### Wood or Tree

* Can either see a wood or a tree.

* Clinical trials vs personalized medicine: Obtaining statistical power where interventions are subtle. e.g. social media
