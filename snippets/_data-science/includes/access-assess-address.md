\subsection{Access, Assess, Address}

\notes{Here we present the philosophy behind Access, Assess, Address. Rather than a formal process, these three words are meant to highlight three distinct types of data science activity that occur within a data science project.}

\notes{There are formal processes designed for, e.g., data mining, but they are not always appropriate for operational science or continuous deployment. One is the CRISP-DM @Chapman-step00 process, which does a nice job of capturing the cyclic nature of these processes, but fails to capture the need to build resources that answer questions in real time that occurs in operational science.}

\notes{The "Access, Assess, Address" paradigm is inspired by experience in operational data science both in the Amazon supply chain and in dealing with the UK pCovid-19 pandemic.}
