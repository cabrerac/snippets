There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!


### Data 

* 90% of our time is spent on validation and integration (Leo Anthony Celi)
* "The Dirty Work We Don't Want to Think About" (Eric Xing)
* "Voodoo to get it decompressed" (Francisco Giminez?)
* In health care clinicians collect the data and often control the direction of research through guardianship of data.

### Value

* How do we measure value in the data economy?
* How do we encourage data workers: curation and management
  * Incentivization for sharing and production.
  * Quantifying the value in the contribution of *each actor*.
