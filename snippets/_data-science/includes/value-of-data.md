### Quantifying the Value of Data

There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!


### Data 

* 90% of our time is spent on validation and integration (Leo Anthony Celi)
* "The Dirty Work We Don't Want to Think About" (Eric Xing)
* "Voodoo to get it decompressed" (Francisco Giminez?)
* In health care clinicians collect the data and often control the direction of research through guardianship of data.

### Value

* How do we measure value in the data economy?
* How do we encourage data workers: curation and management
  * Incentivization for sharing and production.
  * Quantifying the value in the contribution of *each actor*.

### Credit Allocation

* Direct work on data generates an enormous amount of 'value' in the data economy but this is unaccounted in the economy

* Hard because data is difficult to 'embody'

* Value of shared data: [Wellcome Trust 2010 Joint Statement](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/sharing-research-data-improve-public-health-full-joint-statement-funders-health) (from the "Foggy Bottom" meeting)

### Solutions

* Encourage greater interaction between application domains and data scientists

* Encourage visualization of data

* Adoption of 'data readiness levels'

* Implications for incentivization schemes
