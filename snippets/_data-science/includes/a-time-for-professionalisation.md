### Data Science

* Industrial Revolution 4.0?

* *Industrial Revolution* (1760-1840) term coined by Arnold Toynbee,
late 19th century.

* Maybe: But this one is dominated by *data* not *capital*

* That presents *challenges* and *opportunities*

### A Time for Professionalisation?

* New technologies historically led to new professions:
    * Brunel (born 1806): Civil, mechanical, naval
    * Tesla (born 1856): Electrical and power
    * William Shockley (born 1910): Electronic 
    * Watts S. Humphrey (born 1927): Software

### Why?

* Codification of best practice.
* Developing trust

### Where are we?

* Perhaps around the 1980s of programming.
    * We understand ```if```, ```for```, and procedures
    * But we don't share best practice.

* Let's *avoid* the over formalisation of software engineering.
