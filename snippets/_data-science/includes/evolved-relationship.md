\notes{### Evolved Relationship 

\includesvg{../slides/diagrams/data-science/information-flow003.svg}

The high bandwidth of computers has resulted in a close relationship between the computer and data. Larege amounts of information can flow between the two. The degree to which the computer is mediating our relationship with data means that we should consider it an intermediary. 

Origininally our low bandwith relationship with data was affected by two characteristics. Firstly, our tendency to over-interpret driven by our need to extract as much knowledge from our low bandwidth information channel as possible. Secondly, by our improved understanding of the domain of *mathematical* statistics and how our cognitive biases can mislead us. 

With this new set up there is a potential for assimilating far more information via the computer, but the computer can present this to us in various ways. If it's motives are not aligned with ours then it can misrepresent the information. This needn't be nefarious it can be simply as a result of the computer pursuing a different objective from us. For example, if the computer is aiming to maximize our interaction time that may be a different objective from ours which may be to summarize information in a representative manner in the *shortest* possible lenght of time. 

For example, for me it was  a common experience to pick up my telephone with the intention of checking when my next appointme was, but to soon find myself  distracted by another application on the phone, and end up reading something on the internet. By the time I'd finished reading, I would often have forgotten the reason I picked up my phone in the first place. 

We can benefit enormously from the very large amount of information we can now obtain through this evolved relationship between us and data. Biology has already benefited from large scale data sharing and the improved inferences that can be drawn through summarizing data by computer. That has underpinned the revolution in computational biology. But in our daily lives this phenomenon is affecting us in ways which we haven't envisaged.

Better mediation of this flow actually requires a better understanding of human-computer interaction. This in turn involves understanding our own intelligence better, what its cognitive biases are and how these might mislead us.

\notes{We have already seen the effects of this changed dynamic in biology and computational biology. Improved sensorics have led to the new domains of transcriptomics, epigenomics, and 'rich phenomics' as well as considerably augmenting our capabilities in genomics. 

Biologists have had to become data-savvy, they require a rich understanding of the available data resources and need to assimilate existing data sets in their hypothesis generation as well as their experimental design. Modern biology has become a far more quantitative science, but the quantitativeness has required new methods developed in the domains of *computational biology* and *bioinformatics*.}

### Effects

* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.
    * Large scale data acquisition and distribution.
    * Transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, 'rich phenomics'.
}

\notes{We can expect to see these phenomena reflected in wider society. Particularly as we make use of more automated decision making based only on data.}

\slides{
### Societal Effects

* Automated decision making within the computer based only on the data.
* A requirement to better understand our own subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface formulates the correct conclusions from the data.
}

### Societal Effects

* Shift in dynamic from the direct pathway between human and data to indirect pathway between human and data via the computer
* This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging domain of data science
