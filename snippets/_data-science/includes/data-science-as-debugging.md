\subsection{Data Science as Debugging}

\notes{One challenge for existing information technology professionals
is realizing the extent to which a software ecosystem based on data
differs from a classical ecosystem. In particular, by ingesting data
we bring unknowns/uncontrollables into our decision making
system. This presents opportunity for adversarial exploitation and
unforeseen operation.}

\notes{Starting with the analysis of a data set, the nature of data
science is somewhat difference from classical software engineering.}

\notes{One analogy I find helpful for understanding the depth of
change we need is the following. Imagine as a software engineer, you
find a USB stick on the ground. And for some reason you *know* that on
that USB stick is a particular API call that will enable you to make a
significant positive difference on a business problem. You don't know
which of the many library functions on the USB stick are the ones that
will help. And it could be that some of those library functions will
hinder, perhaps because they are just inappropriate or perhaps because
they have been placed there malisciously. The most secure thing to do
would be to *not* introduce this code into your production system at all. But
what if your manager told you to do so, how would you go about
incorporating this code base?}

\notes{The answer is *very* carefully. You would have to engage in a process
more akin to debugging than regular software engineering. As you
understood the code base, for your work to be reproducible, you should
be documenting it, not just what you discovered, but how you discovered
it. In the end, you typically find a single API call that is the one
that most benefits your system. But more thought has been placed into
this line of code than any line of code you have written before.}

\notes{An enormous amount of debugging would be required. As the
nature of the code base is understood, software tests to verify it
also need to be constructed. At the end of all your work, the lines of
software you write to actually interact with the software on the USB
stick are likely to be minimal. But more thought would be put into
those lines than perhaps any other lines of code in the system.}

\notes{Even then, when your API code is introduced into your production system,
it needs to be deployed in an environment that monitors it. We cannot
rely on an individualâ€™s decision making to ensure the quality of all our
systems. We need to create an environment that includes quality
controls, checks and bounds, tests, all designed to ensure that
assumptions made about this foreign code base are remaining valid.}

\notes{This situation is akin to what we are doing when we incorporate data in
our production systems. When we are consuming data from others, we
cannot assume that it has been produced in alignment with our goals for
our own systems. Worst case, it may have been adversarialy produced. A
further challenge is that data is dynamic. So, in effect, the code on
the USB stick is evolving over time.}

\notes{It might see that this process is easy to formalize now, we
simply need to check what the formal software engineering process is
for debugging, because that is the current software engineering
activity that data science is closest to. But when we look for a
formalization of debugging we find that there is none. Indeed, modern
software engineering mainly focusses on ensuring that code is written
without bugs in the first place.}

\slides{
* Anecdotally for a given challenge 
    * 80% of time is spent on data wrangling.
	* 20% of time spent on modelling.
* Many companies employ ML Engineers focussing on *models* not *data*.
}

\recommendation{Anecdotally, resolving a machine learning challenge
requires 80% of the resource to be focused on the data and perhaps 20%
to be focused on the model. But many companies are too keen to employ
machine learning engineers who focus on the models, not the data. We
should change our hiring priorities and training. Universities cannot
provide the understanding of how to data-wrangle.  Companies must fill
this gap.}
