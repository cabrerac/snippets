\newslide{Our Vision}

> We don't know what science we'll want to do in 5 years time, but we won't want slower experiments, we won't want more expensive experiments and we won't want a narrower selection of experiments.

\newslide{What do we want?}

* Faster, cheaper and more diverse experiments.
* Better ecosystems for experimentation.
* Data oriented architectures.
