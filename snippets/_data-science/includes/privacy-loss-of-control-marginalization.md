### Privacy, Loss of Control and Marginalization

* Society is becoming harder to monitor

* Individual is becoming easier to monitor

### Discrimination

* Marketing can become more sinister when the target of the marketing is well understood and the (digital) environment of the target is also so well controlled

* Potential for explicit and implicit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexuality, health status

* All prohibited under European law, but can pass unawares, or be implicit


### Marginalization

* Credit scoring, insurance, medical treatment
* What if certain sectors of society are under-represented in our aanalysis?
* What if Silicon Valley develops everything for us?

### Digital Revolution and Inequality?

### Amelioration

* Work to ensure individual retains control of their own data
* We accept privacy in our real lives, need to accept it in our digital
* Control of persona and ability to project

* Need better technological solutions: trust and algorithms.
