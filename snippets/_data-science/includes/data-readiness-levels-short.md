}

\notes{[Data Readiness Levels](http://inverseprobability.com/2017/01/12/data-readiness-levels) [@Lawrence:drl17] are an attempt to develop a language around data quality that can bridge the gap between technical solutions and decision makers such as managers and project planners. The are inspired by Technology Readiness Levels which attempt to quantify the readiness of technologies for deployment.}

\notes{Data-readiness describes, at its coarsest level,  three separate stages of data graduation.}

* Grade C - accessibility

* Grade B - validity

* Grade A - usability
