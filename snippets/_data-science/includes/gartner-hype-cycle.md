\notes{
The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle) tries to assess where an idea is in terms of maturity and adoption. It splits the evolution of technology into a technological trigger, a peak of expectations followed by a trough of disillusionment and a final ascension into a useful technology. It looks rather like a classical control response to a final set point.
