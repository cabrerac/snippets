### Credit Allocation

* Direct work on data generates an enormous amount of 'value' in the data economy but this is unaccounted in the economy

* Hard because data is difficult to 'embody'

* Value of shared data: [Wellcome Trust 2010 Joint Statement](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/sharing-research-data-improve-public-health-full-joint-statement-funders-health) (from the "Foggy Bottom" meeting)

### Solutions

* Encourage greater interaction between application domains and data scientists

* Encourage visualization of data

* Adoption of 'data readiness levels'

* Implications for incentivization schemes
