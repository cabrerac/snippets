\notes{Data Science Africa is a bottom up initiative for capacity building in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence on the African continent. 

As of 2019 there have been five colocated schools and workshops located in Nyeri, Kenya (twice); Kampala, Uganda; Arusha, Tanzania and Abuja, Nigeria. In 2019 there are two events scheduled in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Accra, Ghana.

The main notion is *end-to-end* data science. E.g., going from data collection in the farmer's field to decision making in the Ministry of Agriculture. Or from malaria counts in health centers, to medicine distribution.}

\notes{The philosophy is laid out in [@Lawrence:dsa15]. The key idea is that the modern *information infrastructure* presents new solutions to old problems. Modes of development change because less capital investment is required to take advantage of this infrastructure. The philosophy is that local capacity building is the right way to leverage these challenges in addressing data science problems in the African context.}

\notes{Data Science Africa is now a non-govermental organization registered in Kenya. The organising board of the meeting is entirely made up of scientists and academics based on the African continent.}
