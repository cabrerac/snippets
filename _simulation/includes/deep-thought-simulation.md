\subsection{Deep Thought}

\slides{* Deep Thought computed for 7.5 million years
* Found answer: "42"
* Problem wasn't the computation
* Problem was understanding the question
* Built Earth as a computer to find question
* Lesson: Having precise equations/answers isn't enough
    * Need to understand emergent properties
    * Can't compute everything directly
    * Universe does computation for us}

\notes{In Douglas Adams's *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* the computer Deep Thought is asked to provide the answer to the 'great question' of 'life, the universe and everything'. After seven and a half million years of computation, Deep Thought has completed its program but is reluctant to give its creators the answer.

> 'You're really not going to like it,' observed Deep Thought.\
> 'Tell us!'\
> 'All right,' said Deep Thought. 'The Answer to the Great Question . . .'\
> 'Yes . . . !'\
> 'Of Life, the Universe and Everything ...' said Deep Thought.\
> 'Yes ... !'\
> 'Is ...' said Deep Thought, and paused.\
> 'Yes ... !'\
> 'Is ...'\
> 'Yes ... !!! ... ?'\
> 'Forty-two,' said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.

After a period of shock from the questioners, the machine goes on to explain:

> 'I checked it very thoroughly,' said the computer, 'and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is.'
>
> Douglas Adams *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, 1979, Chapter 28

To understand the question, Deep Thought goes on to agree to design a computer which will work out what the question is. In the book that machine is the planet Earth, and its operators are mice. Deep Thought's idea is that the mice will observe the Earth and their observations will allow them to know what the Great Question is.}

\notes{To understand the consequences of Hawking's Theory of Everything, we would have to carry out a scheme similar to Deep Thought's. The Theory wouldn't directly tell us that hurricanes exist or that when the sun sets on Earth the sky will have a red hue. It wouldn't directly tell us that water will boil at 100 degrees centigrade. These consequences of the Theory would only play out once it was combined with the data to give us the emergent qualities of the Universe. The Deep Thought problem hints at the intractability of doing this. The computation required to make predictions from Laplace's demon can be enormous, Deep Thought intends to create a planet to run it. As a result, this isn't how our intelligence works in practice. The computations required are just too gargantuan. Relative to the scale of the Universe our brains are extremely limited. Fortunately though, to make these predictions, we don't have to build our own Universe, because we've already got one.}
