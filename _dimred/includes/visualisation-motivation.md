\subsection{Visualization and Human Perception}

\notes{The human visual system is remarkable - it represents our highest bandwidth connection to the world around us, with the optic tract carrying around 8.75 million bits per second of information to our brain [@Koch-eyebrain06]. The "nerve" is misnamed, it is actually an extension of brain tissue, highlighting how central vision is to our cognitive architecture. Our (bidrectional) verbal communication is limited to around 2,000 bits per minute, but our eyes actively grab at information from our environment at vastly higher rates. This "active sensing" approach, see e.g. @Mackay-behind91 and @ORegan-whyred19, means we don't passively receive visual information but actively construct our understanding through rapid eye movements called saccades that sample our environment hundreds of times per second.}

\slides{
* Human visual system is our highest bandwidth connection to the world
    * Optic tract: ~8.75 million bits/second
    * Verbal communication: only ~2,000 bits/minute
* Active sensing through rapid eye movements (saccades)
    * Not passive reception
    * Actively construct understanding
    * Hundreds of samples per second

\notes{The high-bandwidth visual channel makes visualization a powerful tool for communication and understanding. But it also makes us vulnerable to manipulation through misleading. Just as social media algorithms can manipulate our behavior through careful curation of information, indeed they sometimes manipulate us through our visual system, poorly designed or deliberately deceptive visualizations can lead us to incorrect conclusions by hijacking our natural visual processing capabilities.}

* Visualization is powerful for communication
* But can be vulnerable to manipulation
    * Similar to social media algorithms
    * Misleading visualizations can deceive
    * Can hijack natural visual processing

\notes{In this lecture we'll introduce the basics of visualisation through the lens of dimensionality reduction - techniques that help us represent high-dimensional data.}
