\subsection{Practical Tips for Dimensionality Reduction}

\notes{While the theoretical foundations of dimensionality reduction are important, success in practice often comes down to following some key principles and understanding common pitfalls.}

\subsection{Always Start with PCA}

\notes{One of the most important practical tips for dimensionality reduction is to always start with PCA:}

\slides{
* "Do PCA, always"
* Quick sanity check
* Provides baseline
* Helps understand data
}

\notes{There are several reasons for this:

1. It's fast and deterministic (up to reflections)
2. It provides a baseline for more complex methods
3. It can reveal linear structure you might have missed
4. The eigenvalue spectrum gives you information about dimensionality
5. It helps identify potential issues with your data}

\subsection{Understanding Matrix Structure}

\notes{Learn to extract information from key matrices:}

\slides{
* Learn to read Gram matrices
* Check distance matrices
* Look for block structure
* Identify outliers
}

\notes{Key patterns to look for:

1. In Gram matrices:
   * Block structure suggests clusters
   * Diagonal dominance suggests noise
   * Banded structure suggests ordering
     
2. In distance matrices:
   * Look for natural groupings
   * Check for anomalous distances
   * Verify triangle inequality}

\subsection{Understanding Matrix Structure}

\notes{Learn to extract information from key matrices. Here's an example using the oil flow data:}

\setupcode{import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import gridspec
import mlai}

\setupcode{import pods}

\include{_datasets/includes/oil-flow-data.md}

\code{# Load the oil data
# Compute the Gram matrix
gram = X @ X.T

# Create a figure with two subplots
fig = plt.figure(figsize=plot.bigwide_figsize)
gs = gridspec.GridSpec(1, 2, width_ratios=[1, 1])

# Plot the Gram matrix
ax0 = plt.subplot(gs[0])
im = ax0.imshow(gram, cmap='viridis')
ax0.set_title('Gram Matrix')
plt.colorbar(im)

# Plot the first two dimensions of data
ax1 = plt.subplot(gs[1])
ax1.scatter(Y[:, 0], Y[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
ax1.set_title('Data Scatter Plot')
ax1.set_xlabel('Dimension 1')
ax1.set_ylabel('Dimension 2')

plt.tight_layout()
mlai.write_figure('matrix-structure.svg', directory='\writeDiagramsDir/dimred')}

\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/dimred/matrix-structure}{80%}}{The Gram matrix (left) reveals the underlying structure in our data, while the scatter plot (right) shows the first two dimensions. Notice how patterns in the Gram matrix correspond to clusters in the data.}{matrix-structure}

* Check distance matrices
* Look for block structure
* Identify outliers}

\subsection{Examining Projections}

\notes{When working with high-dimensional data, systematically examine different projections:}

\slides{
* Look at multiple 2D views
* Check consecutive dimensions
* Examine suspicious patterns
* Plot residuals}

\includediagram{\diagramsDir/dimred/projection-examples}

\notes{Useful projection strategies:

1. Plot consecutive pairs of dimensions
2. Project onto principal components
3. Look at random projections
4. Examine projections that show unusual patterns
5. Consider targeted projections based on feature knowledge}

\subsection{Evaluating Neighborhoods}

\notes{Understanding local structure is crucial for many methods:}

\slides{
* Check $k$-nearest neighbors
* Verify local distances
* Look for disconnected regions
* Examine boundary points
}

\notes{Important neighborhood checks:

1. Are neighbors sensible for different values of $k$?
2. Are there isolated points or clusters?
3. Do distances make sense locally?
4. Are there boundary effects?
5. How stable are the neighborhoods?}

\subsection{Common Pitfalls}

\notes{Be aware of common issues that can affect results:}

\slides{
* Not scaling features appropriately
* Ignoring outliers
* Using wrong distance metric
* Trusting single visualization
* Assuming linearity}

\notes{Key things to watch out for:

1. Feature scaling can dramatically affect results
2. Outliers can dominate the analysis
3. Choice of distance metric matters
4. Single visualizations can be misleading
5. Linear methods might miss important structure}

\subsection{Validation Strategies}

\notes{Always validate your dimensionality reduction:}

\slides{
* Check reconstruction error
* Verify known relationships
* Test with held-out data
* Compare multiple methods
}

\notes{Useful validation approaches:

1. Compare results from different methods
2. Check if known relationships are preserved
3. Verify whether the reduction preserves important structure
4. Test stability with different subsets of data
5. Use domain knowledge to validate results}

\subsection{Implementation Guidelines}

\notes{When implementing dimensionality reduction:}

\slides{
* Start simple
* Scale appropriately
* Check intermediate results
* Validate assumptions
* Document choices}

\notes{Follow these steps:

1. Begin with simple methods like PCA
2. Scale and preprocess data appropriately
3. Check intermediate results at each step
4. Validate assumptions about your data
5. Document all preprocessing and parameter choices}
