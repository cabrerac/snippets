\subsection{Practical Considerations}

\notes{When applying dimensionality reduction in practice, there are several important considerations:

1. How to choose the latent dimensionality
2. How to validate the reduction is capturing important structure
3. What preprocessing steps are needed}

\setupcode{import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mlai.plot as plot}

\code{def plot_data_reconstruction(X, dim_reducer, num_components):
    """Visualize reconstruction error vs number of components"""
    errors = []
    dims = range(1, num_components+1)
    
    for d in dims:
        dim_reducer.set_params(n_components=d)
        X_reduced = dim_reducer.fit_transform(X)
        X_reconstructed = dim_reducer.inverse_transform(X_reduced)
        error = np.mean((X - X_reconstructed) ** 2)
        errors.append(error)
        
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=plot.big_wide_figsize)
    ax.plot(dims, errors, 'b-')
    ax.set_xlabel('Number of Components')
    ax.set_ylabel('Reconstruction Error')
    ax.set_yscale('log')}

\notes{One common approach for choosing the latent dimensionality is to look at the reconstruction error as a function of the number of components. An "elbow" in this curve often suggests a good tradeoff between complexity and accuracy.

Before applying dimensionality reduction, it's usually important to:
1. Center the data by removing the mean
2. Scale features to have unit variance if they're on different scales 
3. Handle missing values appropriately}
