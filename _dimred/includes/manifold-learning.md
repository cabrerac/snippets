\subsection{Manifold Learning}


\notes{Having established what manifolds are and how MDS works with Euclidean distances, we now consider how to learn manifold structure from data. The key insight is using the manifold's local Euclidean property while respecting its global structure.}

\subsection{The Local-Global Problem}

\slides{
* Manifold locally resembles Euclidean space
* Global distances may not be meaningful
* Need to build global from local
}

\notes{The fundamental challenge of manifold learning stems from the manifold definition:
1. We can trust local distances/relationships
2. Global Euclidean distances may be meaningless
3. We need to construct global structure from local information}

\subsection{Proximity Graphs}

\notes{The key to manifold learning is constructing a proximity graph that captures local structure.}

\slides{
* Connect nearby points
* Weight by local distance
* Forms basis for global structure
}

\notes{A proximity graph is constructed by:
1. Identifying neighbors for each point
2. Connecting points that are neighbors
3. Weighting edges by local distances
4. Using this graph to approximate manifold structure}

\subsection{Local Neighborhood Methods}

\notes{There are several ways to define local neighborhoods:}

\slides{
* k-nearest neighbors
* ε-balls
* Mutual k-nearest neighbors
* Trade-offs in each approach
}

\includediagram{\diagramsDir/dimred/neighborhood-types}

\notes{Each approach has its advantages:
* k-nearest neighbors ensures each point has connections
* ε-balls preserve scale information
* Mutual k-nearest neighbors can give sparser graphs
The choice depends on your data and objectives.}

\subsection{From Local to Global}

\notes{Once we have local neighborhoods, we need to build global structure. This typically involves:}

\slides{
1. Build proximity graph
2. Compute graph distances
3. Convert to embedding
}

\includediagram{\diagramsDir/dimred/local-to-global}

\notes{This process requires several careful choices:
1. How to define neighborhoods
2. How to weight edges
3. How to convert graph distances to coordinates}

\subsection{Example: Swiss Roll}

\notes{The Swiss roll example clearly illustrates these concepts:}

\slides{
* Points nearby on manifold
* Far in ambient space
* Local neighborhoods crucial
}

\includediagram{\diagramsDir/dimred/swiss-roll-neighborhoods}

\notes{In the Swiss roll:
1. Points that are close in 3D might be far along the manifold
2. Local neighborhoods should follow the surface
3. Global structure emerges from combining local neighborhoods}

\subsection{Learning the Manifold}

\notes{The actual process of manifold learning involves:}

\slides{
* Build proximity graph
* Complete distance relationships
* Apply dimensionality reduction
}

\notes{1. Constructing a proximity graph that respects local structure
2. Using this graph to estimate distances along the manifold
3. Applying dimensionality reduction to reveal the manifold's structure
This forms the basis for algorithms like Isomap.}

\subsection{Practical Considerations}

\notes{When applying manifold learning in practice, consider:}

\slides{
* Choice of local neighborhood
* Robustness to noise
* Computational complexity
* Validation of results
}

\notes{Key practical issues include:
1. How to choose neighborhood size
2. How to handle noise in the data
3. How to validate the learned structure
4. What dimensionality to use for the embedding
5. How to handle holes or discontinuities in the manifold}
