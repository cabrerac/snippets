\notes{Popper opened the preface to his book [@Popper-open45] with the
following words:}

> If in this book harsh words are spoken about some of the greatest
> among the intellectual leaders of mankind, my motive is not, I hope,
> to belittle them. It springs rather from my conviction that, if our
> civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference
> to great men. Great men may make great mistakes; and as the book tries
> to show, some of the greatest leaders of the past supported the
> perennial attack on freedom and reason.


\notes{He had written the book against the background of the second world war,
his decision to write it taken on the day the Nazis invaded Austria in
March 1938. His book is a reaction to totalitarianism.}

\notes{For Popper, the ideas of "great men" become totalitarian when
imposed on society. He advocates for direct liberal democracy as the
only form of government that can allow for institutional change
without bloodshed. The open society is one characterized by
institutions and individuals that can engage in the practical pursuit
of solutions to social and political problems. The institutions are
also underpinned by individuals: lawyers, accountants, civil
administrators and many more. To Popper it is these "piecemeal social
engineers" who offer pragmatic solutions to our society's political
and social challenges.}
