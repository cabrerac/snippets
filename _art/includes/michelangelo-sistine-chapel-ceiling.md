\notes{When we got to Cambridge, we both attended [Patrick Boyde](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/pb127)'s talks on chapel. He focussed on both the structure of the chapel ceiling, describing the impression of height it was intended to give, as well as the significance and positioning of each of the panels and the meaning of the individual figures.}
