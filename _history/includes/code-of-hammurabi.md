\subsection{The Code of Hammurabi}

\notes{The earliest written
systems of law come from Babylon. One of them is the code of Hammurabi,
named for a Babylonian king who ruled nearly 4,000 years ago.}

\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/history/code-of-hammurabi}{30%}}{The code of Hammurabi is estimated to come from around 1750 BC, it is not the first legal codification but one of the best organised. It is written in a dialect of Akkadian. Hammurabi was the sixth king from the first Babylonian dynasty. The code is inscribed on a basalt rock that is over two meters tall.}{code-of-hammurabi}

\notes{The second law of the code describes [trial by ordeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal). The ordeal involved leaping or being thrown in to a river. If an accused survived this then they were acquitted.}
