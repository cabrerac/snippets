\subsection{The Trial of Siyatu}


\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/history/trial-of-siyatu-lineart}{15%}}{Cuneiform tablet of unknown scribe written between 1250 and 1200 bce, found in Ur, trans. Jonathan Tenney. The text is known as ‘UET 7 11’. It was excavated at the ancient city of Ur and now rests in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. Oliver R. Gurney (1974), ‘Middle Babylonian legal documents and other texts’, Ur Excavations. Texts 7 (London: The Trustees of the Two Museums). The translation is by my colleague Dr Jonathan Tenney.

\notes{[Jonathan Tenney](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-jonathan-tenney) is an Assyriologist who spends his days reading these
ancient texts. His domain of expertise is the city of Nippur, where
Gilgamesh built the great gate. The period Jonathan studies is 2,000
years after the reign of Gilgamesh. Through his studies he can give
snapshots of life in these cities. One of these snapshots is a trial
that took place under Hammurabi's code. The trial concerned the
disappearance of an ox. Cases were presided over by a shakannakku,
normally a representative of the king.}

\notes{The record reads almost in note form, so it might be worth a quick
review of what we think happened. Nergal-aha-iddina[^16] was the
original owner of an ox, which he loaned to Sin-bununi.[^17] When
Nergal-aha-iddina wanted his ox back, Sin-bununi said the ox had died
and that Siyatu,[^18] Nergal-aha-iddina's servant, had taken the corpse.

[^16]: In Akkadian, names invoke gods and have meanings we can only
    summarize in sentences. Negal was the god of war and plague;
    Nergal-aha-iddina means 'Nergal gave me a brother.' Today lots of
    Hindi names share this characteristic, for example Subramanian means
    'dear to Brahmam', and Ramanujan means 'younger brother of Rama'.

[^17]: Sin was the god of the Moon, and Sin-bununi means 'Sin is our
    goodness'.

[^18]: Siyatu's name is shorter, indicating that it's either the
    shortening of a longer name or a foreign name.}

\notes{The case described in the tablet is unusual for two reasons. First, the
shakannakku was normally a royal proxy but in this case we are told it
was the King of Babylon himself, Adad-šuma-usur.[^19] Second, the
judgement is for a trial by water ordeal. Someone is going to be thrown
into the river; guilt will be decided by whether the water rejects them
or absorbs them.

[^19]: Adad was a god of storms. Adad-šuma-usur is 'O Adad, safeguard
    the offspring.'}

\notes{The tablet contains words, but its interpretation requires knowledge.
Jonathan[^20] was kind enough to let me and my students watch him
transliterate the tablet, and as he worked he used books, computer
databases, his own expert knowledge and also his sense of what it means
to be a human. The suspicion is that Sin-bununi may have sold the ox
because his explanation of events -- that the ox died and the servant,
Siyatu, came, took the body and fed it to a dog -- feels like a version
of the modern 'dog ate my homework' excuse. The case hinges on an
accusation, but it's one person's word against another.

[^20]: 'A gift of Yeho', where Yeho is the name of a later Levantine god
    who gained popularity from the Iron Age and eventually supplanted
    Jupiter for the Romans.}

\notes{This judgement was passed over 3,200 years ago but, like a modern case,
making it would have involved listening to witness statements and then
coming to a decision. The choice of trial by ordeal implies that the
witness statements conflicted and the King felt he couldn't decide on
the basis of the evidence. The trial by ordeal passes the
decision-making from the shakannakku to the gods; it's cleromancy with
fatal implications. From the translation, it's not quite clear who's
going in the river ... is it Siyatu the servant or Sin-bununi the
accuser? My human cynicism suspects it's the servant that's going to get
wet. Even over 3,000 years later, despite the different cultural
landscape, we can still imagine something about the power dynamics at
play, and my gut tells me that putting the servant through the ordeal
will be the most palatable solution to the King.}

\notes{Sin-bununi's story for explaining what happened to the body of the ox
reads suspiciously, but while we can speculate about what happened, we
can't know exactly what did happen -- there is uncertainty. Even at the
time of the trial, the King felt unable to make a decision, so given he
wasn't able to establish the truth so many years ago, we're unlikely to
find it now. This is a cold case, so cold it's deep frozen, but anyone
reading the story can't help but try to defrost it through the warmth of
their human understanding.}

\notes{We may think we've moved beyond the idea of trial by ordeal, but I see a
similar trend emerging with our desire to use AI systems for
consequential decisions. When humans feel unable to pass judgement they
are tempted to pass the decision on to what they believe to be an
omniscient entity, but the gremlin of uncertainty means the machine is
not omniscient -- putting consequential decisions on machines implies
that you will be exchanging human error for machine error. That is
problematic because the machine can never feel the consequences of those
errors as it is not subject to the same vulnerabilities as us. That is
why it's vital the human remains in ultimate control. That's not to say
the human should ignore the machine; rather, we would like the machine
to augment our understanding.}
