\subsection{Engineering Consultation in the Age of AI}

\notes{Engineering consultants today face a unique challenge at the intersection of human and machine capabilities. The tendency to focus purely on technical solutions can obscure crucial human factors that determine a system's success or failure in practice.}

\slides{* Key considerations:
    * Human-system interaction
    * Embedded assumptions
    * Agency vs Automation
    * Explainability vs Efficiency}

\notes{When developing solutions, four critical factors must be balanced:
1. How will humans interact with and understand the system?
2. What assumptions are we embedding in our design?
3. How can we maintain human agency while leveraging automation?
4. Where should we prioritize explainability over efficiency?

These questions reflect the fundamental tension between human understanding and machine capability that lies at the heart of modern engineering challenges.}
