\notes{The evolution of feedback in engineering systems tells us a crucial story about human-machine interaction. Test pilots like Amelia Earhart and Stefan Cavallo developed an intimate understanding of their aircraft through direct physical feedback - the vibrations, the sounds, the feel of the controls. This physical connection allowed for rapid adaptation and learning.}

\notes{Modern commercial airliners now use fly-by-wire, with the two main manufacturers choosing different routes. Boeing's system aims to emulate the tactile feedback and forces that would have come from direct connection of the control column to the control surfaces. Airbus's sytem is a smaller control stick that is flown by one hand and does not feed back to the haptic signals to the pilot.}

\subsection{Physical and Digital Feedback}

\slides{* Physical Feedback:
    * Test pilots feel aircraft response
    * Watt's governor directly senses speed
    * Immediate physical connection
* Digital Feedback:
    * Abstract measurements
    * Delayed response
    * Hidden failure modes}

\notes{James Watt's governor exemplifies this physical intelligence - centrifugal force directly controlling steam flow through mechanical linkages. The feedback loop is immediate, physical, and comprehensible. Modern digital systems, however, have lost this direct connection, replacing it with layers of abstraction between sensing and action.}

\notes{Physical feedback and digital feedback differ, physical feedback is interpreted through our quick reacting motor intelligence. Digital feedback will be processed by slower reacting systems, although there will still be a spectrum. For example our reaction to being shown a disturbing image or receiving fake news that confirms our prejudices will be slower than a direct motor response but faster than a mathematical puzzle.}
