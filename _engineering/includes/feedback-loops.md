\notes{The evolution of feedback in engineering systems tells us a crucial story about human-machine interaction. Test pilots like Stefan Cavallo and Amelia Earhart developed an intimate understanding of their aircraft through direct physical feedback - the vibrations, the sounds, the feel of the controls. This physical connection allowed for rapid adaptation and learning.}

\subsection{Physical and Digital Feedback}

\slides{* Physical Feedback:
    * Test pilots feel aircraft response
    * Watt's governor directly senses speed
    * Immediate physical connection
* Digital Feedback:
    * Abstract measurements
    * Delayed response
    * Hidden failure modes}

\notes{James Watt's governor exemplifies this physical intelligence - centrifugal force directly controlling steam flow through mechanical linkages. The feedback loop is immediate, physical, and comprehensible. Modern digital systems, however, have lost this direct connection, replacing it with layers of abstraction between sensing and action.}
