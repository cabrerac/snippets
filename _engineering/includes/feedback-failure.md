\notes{\subsection{When Feedback Fails}}

\notes{The contrast between physical and digital feedback becomes stark when we examine modern system failures. While test pilots could feel their aircraft's responses and adapt accordingly, modern digital systems often fail silently, with consequences that can go undetected for years.}

\slides{* Historical Examples:
    * NACA test pilots: direct feedback
    * Amelia Earhart: physical understanding
* Modern Failures:
    * Horizon scandal: hidden errors
    * Lorenzo system: disconnected feedback
    * Lives ruined by lack of understanding}

\notes{The Horizon scandal and Lorenzo NHS system represent catastrophic failures of digital feedback. Unlike a test pilot who can feel when something is wrong, or Watt's governor which fails visibly, these digital systems created a false sense of confidence while masking their failures. The human operators - whether post office workers or healthcare professionals - were disconnected from the true state of the system, leading to devastating consequences.}

\notes{This fundamental shift from physical to digital feedback represents one of the greatest challenges in modern engineering: how do we maintain meaningful human understanding and control as our systems become increasingly abstract?}
