\subsection{Engineering Complexity and Understanding}

\notes{The challenge of understanding complex systems has evolved dramatically since the early days of mechanical engineering. While the Apollo guidance computer contained 145,000 lines of code that were deeply understood by its creators, modern cars contain over 100 million lines. This increase in complexity isn't just about quantity - it represents a fundamental shift in our ability to comprehend the systems we build.}

* Understanding vs Volume
* Program alarms and deep knowledge}

\notes{The Apollo 11 landing provides a crucial lesson. When program alarms indicated computer overload, it was the deep understanding of the system's priorities by the Mission Control team that allowed them to continue safely. This level of comprehension is increasingly rare in modern systems, where layers of abstraction and automation obscure the underlying mechanisms.}

\notes{For service oriented architectures, as companies have grown in complexity they have more complex interactions between different services.}
