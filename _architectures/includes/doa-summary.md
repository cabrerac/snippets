\subsection{Summary}

\notes{Data-Oriented Architectures provide a valuable paradigm for designing modern AI and data science systems. While each system's specific implementation details will vary based on context, the core principles of DOA provide a robust framework for addressing common challenges in data-driven systems.}

\slides{
Key takeaways:
* Systems share common requirements
* Similar solutions for similar problems
* Data-driven systems need data-centric design
* DOA provides useful design paradigm
* Data-First principle crucial for pipelines
}

\notes{The success of DOA implementations in real-world cases like the water monitoring system, combined with empirical evaluations showing benefits in maintainability and analysis, suggests that this architectural approach will become increasingly important as systems become more data-driven.}
