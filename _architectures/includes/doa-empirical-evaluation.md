\subsection{Empirical Evaluation of DOA}

\notes{Research comparing DOA to traditional SOA approaches has revealed several advantages, particularly in machine learning deployment contexts. The evaluation focused on key metrics that impact system maintainability and evolution.}

\slides{
Key evaluation metrics:
* Number of affected components
* Cognitive complexity
* Maintainability index
}

\newslide{Comparison with SOA}

\notes{Studies have shown that DOA implementations typically require fewer component changes during system evolution, exhibit lower cognitive complexity, and maintain better maintainability scores compared to equivalent SOA implementations.}

\slides{
DOA advantages:
* Fewer component changes needed
* Lower cognitive complexity
* Better maintainability scores
}

\newslide{Causality Analysis}

\notes{One particularly important advantage of DOA is its support for better causality analysis through explicit data flow representation.}

\slides{
Enhanced analysis capabilities:
* Improved fault localization
* Better detection of data shifts
* Complete causal graphs through dataflow
}
