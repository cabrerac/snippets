\subsection{Data-Oriented Architectures}

\notes{Modern AI systems are increasingly data-driven, which creates new challenges and requirements that traditional service-oriented architectures (SOAs) may not adequately address. This has led to the emergence of data-oriented architectures (DOAs) as an alternative architectural pattern that prioritizes data availability, ownership, traceability and monitoring.}

\slides{
* Systems in the age of AI are data-driven:
  * Data availability
  * Data ownership
  * Data traceability and monitoring
  * Super-low latency requirements
  * Sustainability
}

\newslide{The Data Dichotomy}

\notes{A fundamental challenge is what has been called the "Data Dichotomy" - while service-oriented architectures are designed to hide data, data-driven systems need to expose and share data effectively. This creates a need to rethink how we architect AI systems.}

\slides{
> "While data-driven systems are about exposing data, service-oriented architectures are about hiding data."

We need to design systems prioritising data!

\newslide{Core Principles}

\slides{
Three fundamental principles:
* Data-first systems
* Prioritise decentralisation  
* Openness
}
