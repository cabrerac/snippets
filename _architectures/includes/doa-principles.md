\subsection{Core DOA Principles}

\notes{Data-oriented architectures are built on three core principles that address the key requirements of modern AI systems. Each principle targets specific challenges in modern data-driven applications.}

\subsubsection{Data-First Principle}

\notes{The data-first principle puts data at the center of system design, ensuring that data flows are prioritized over service interfaces.}

\slides{
* Prioritizes data availability
* Enables data traceability
* Makes data the central organizing principle
}

\newslide{Decentralization}

\notes{Decentralization helps address latency and scalability challenges by distributing both data and processing across the system.}

\slides{
* Distributes processing across system
* Enables super-low latency
* Reduces central bottlenecks
}

\newslide{Openness}

\notes{The openness principle ensures that data can be effectively shared and reused while maintaining appropriate governance.}

\slides{
* Supports data ownership
* Enables sustainable practices
* Facilitates data sharing
}

\notes{While few systems fully implement all DOA principles today, various technologies enable partial implementation - databases and message queues for data-first approaches, distributed storage and computing for decentralization, and asynchronous communication for openness.}
