\subsection{Commonalities}

\slides{**Gap between policy (macro) and on ground reality (micro)**
* Insufficient consideration of local needs and systems.
* Lack of effective feedback mechanisms from micro to macro.
* Rigid top-down implementation.
* Insufficient engagement with end users and stake-holders
}
\notes{Key points:
Both cases demonstrate a significant gap between high-level policy decisions (macro) and on-the-ground realities (micro).

   * The failures stemmed from insufficient consideration of local needs, capabilities, and existing systems.
   * There was a lack of effective feedback mechanisms from the micro to macro level.
   * The implementations suffered from overly rigid, top-down approaches that didn't allow for local adaptation.
   * In both cases, there was insufficient engagement with end-users and local stakeholders.}
