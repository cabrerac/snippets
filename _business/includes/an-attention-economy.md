\subsection{An Attention Economy}

\notes{I don't know what the future holds, but there are three things that (in the longer term) I think we can expect to be true.}

1. Human attention will always be a "scarce resource"
2. Humans will never stop being interested in other humans.
3. Organisations will keep trying to "capture" the attention economy.


\notes{Over the next few years our social structures will be significantly disrupted, and during periods of volatility it's difficult to predict what will be financially successful. But in the longer term the scarce resource in the economy will be the "capital" of human attention. Even if all traditionally "productive jobs" such as manufacturing were automated, and sustainable energy problems are resolved, human attention is still the bottle neck in the economy. Beyond that, humans will not stop being interested in other humans, sport is a nice example of this, we are as interested in the human stories of athletes as their achievements (as a series of Netflix productions evidences: Quaterback, Receiver, Drive to Survive, THe Last Dance) etc. Or the "creator economy" on YouTube. While we might prefer a future where the labour in such an economy is distributed, such that we all individually can participate in the creation as well as the consumption, my final thought is that there are significant forces to centralise this so that the many consume from the few, and companies will be financially incentivised to capture this emerging attention economy.
