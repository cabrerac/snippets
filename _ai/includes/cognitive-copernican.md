\notes{\section{Copernican Revolution}}

\notes{In the 16th century Europe underwent a paradigm shift in thinking about how
we are located in our Universe. Formerly, the Earth was seen as being at the centre of the Universe, the heart of God's creation. In a form of psychological bias that is a combination of observer bias and self-serving bias, humans believed that we were the objective.}

\notes{The Copernican revolution displaced the geocentric view of the Universe. But what we had left was our intelligence. It was clear that this differentiated us from other animals and plants. Surely this relocated us at the heart of creation? Today we are undergoing a new Copernican revolution. The same self-serving and observer biases had come to the fore. What we are seeing in AI is the realisation that we are not even cognitively at the centre of the Universe.}
