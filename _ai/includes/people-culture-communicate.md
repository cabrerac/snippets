\subsection{People, Communication and Culture}

\notes{Human intelligence is a social intelligence: it is isolated, but it doesn’t exist in isolation. It sits instead within a broader culture. The term ‘culture’ originates from the Roman orator Cicero, who wrote of cultura animi, the cultivation of our minds. He drew an analogy with agriculture: human knowledge is cultivated similarly to the way crops are raised from the land: our minds grow and respond to their intellectual environment.}

\notes{It is impossible to understand humans without understanding our context, and human culture is a key part of that context, but the cul- ture that sustains our minds is also evolving. Over time, how we see ourselves within the universe has changed. The world looks different to us today than it did to Michelangelo. Many of these changes have improved our ability to understand the world around us.}
