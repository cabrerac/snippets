\subsection{Braitenberg Vehicles}

\notes{In @Braitenberg-vehicles84 Valention Braitenberg considers simple wirings for 'vehicles' that connect sensors directly to motors. He then relates these vehicle's 'behaviour' in different contexts. These vehicles don't have reflective-selves they are merely reflexive. They are integrated in their environment, the information they take in is processed instantaneously. They are not locked-in.}
