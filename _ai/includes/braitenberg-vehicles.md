\subsection{Braitenberg Vehicles}

\notes{In @Braitenberg-vehicles84 Valention Braitenberg considers simple wirings for 'vehicles' that connect sensors directly to motors. He then relates these vehicle's 'behaviour' in different contexts. These vehicles don't have reflective-selves they are merely reflexive. They are integrated in their environment, the information they take in is processed instantaneously. They are not locked-in.}

\notes{Having described the behaviour of his vehciles, he introduces what I think of as ‘Braitenberg’s law’:

> At this point we are ready to make a fundamental discovery. We have gathered evidence for what I call the ‘law of uphill analysis and downhill
> invention’. What I mean is this. It is pleasurable and easy to create little machines that do certain tricks. It is also quite easy to observe the
> full repertoire of behavior of these machines – even if it goes beyond what we had originally planned, as it often does. But it is much more
> difficult to start from the outside and to try to guess internal structure just from the observation of behavior. It is actu- ally impossible in
> theory to determine exactly what the hidden mechanism is without opening the box, since there are always many different mechanisms with identical
> behavior.
