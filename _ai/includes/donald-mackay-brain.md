\notes{Donald MacKay was a physicist who worked on naval gun targeting 
during the Second World War. The challenge with gun targeting for ships 
is that both the target and the gun platform are moving. This was tackled 
using analogue computers - for example, in the US the [Mark I fire control 
computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_I_Fire_Control_Computer), 
which was a mechanical computer. MacKay worked on radar systems for gun 
laying, where the velocity and distance of the target could be assessed 
through radar and a mechanical-electrical analogue computer.}

his interest in the brain.

\notes{MacKay's distinction between *analogue* and *digital* computers 
is key. As an expert in analogue machines, he understood that an 
analogue computer is *literally* an analogue - its components (resistors, 
capacitors, inductors, or mechanical parts like cams and gears) have states
that are physically analogous to the states in system being modeled. Engineers 
designed these computers by exploiting mathematical dualities between the 
computer and the real world. For example a mechanical system (mass-spring-damper) 
and electrical circuit (inductor-resistor-capacitor) could be described by the 
same second-order differential equations, allowing designers to map real-world 
problems through mathematics into virtual representations.}

\notes{MacKay's insights remain relevant when considering modern AI systems. 
His questioning of whether the brain was truly digital or analogue might parallel 
current debates about large language models like Claude and ChatGPT, which seem to 
operate in ways that don't neatly fit either paradigm. His work reminds us that 
understanding the fundamental nature of intelligent systems - whether biological 
or artificial - requires looking beyond simple categorizations.}
