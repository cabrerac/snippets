\notes{In Goethe’s poem The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, a young sorcerer learns
one of their master’s spells and deploys it to assist in his
chores. Unfortunately, he cannot control it. The poem was popularised
by Paul Dukas’s musical composition, in 1940 Disney used the
composition in the film Fantasia. Mickey Mouse plays the role of the
hapless apprentice who deploys the spell but cannot control the
results.}

\notes{When it comes to our software systems, the same thing is
happening. The Harvard Law professor, Jonathan Zittrain
[calls the phenomenon intellectual debt](https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c). In
intellectual debt, like the sorcerer’s apprentice, a software system
is created but it cannot be explained or controlled by its
creator. The phenomenon comes from the difficulty of building and
maintaining large software systems: the complexity of the whole is too
much for any individual to understand, so it is decomposed into
parts. Each part is constructed by a smaller team. The approach is
known as separation of concerns, but it has the unfortunate side
effect that no individual understands how the whole system works. When
this goes wrong, the effects can be devastating. We saw this in the
recent Horizon scandal, where neither the Post Office or Fujitsu were
able to control the accounting system they had deployed, and we saw it
when Facebook’s systems were manipulated to spread misinformation in
the 2016 US election.

When Disney’s Fantasia was released, the philosopher Karl Popper was
in exile in New Zealand.  He wrote
[The Open Society and its Enemies](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691210841/the-open-society-and-its-enemies)
when his hometown of Vienna was under Nazi rule.  The book defends the
political system of liberal democracy against totalitarianism. For
Popper, the open society is one characterised by institutions that can
engage in the pragmatic pursuit of solutions to social and political
problems. Those institutions are underpinned by professions: lawyers,
the accountants, civil administrators. To Popper these “piecemeal
social engineers” are the pragmatic solution to how a society solves
political and social problems.

In 2019 Mark Zuckerberg [wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html) calling
for regulation of social media. He was repeating the realisation of
Goethe’s apprentice, he had released a technology he couldn’t
control. In Goethe’s poem, the master returns, “Besen, besen! Seid’s
gewesen” he calls, and order is restored, but back in the real world
the role of the master is played by Popper’s open
society. Unfortunately, those institutions have been undermined by the
very spell that these modern apprentices have cast. The book, the
letter, the ledger, each of these has been supplanted in our modern
information infrastructure by the computer. The modern scribes are
software engineers, and their guilds are the big tech
companies. Facebook’s motto was to “move fast and break things”. Their
software engineers have done precisely that and the apprentice has
robbed the master of his powers.  This is a desperate situation, and
it’s getting worse. The latest to reprise the apprentice’s role are
Sam Altman and OpenAI who dream of “general intelligence” solutions to
societal problems which OpenAI will develop, deploy, and
control. Popper worried about the threat of totalitarianism to our
open societies, today’s threat is a form of information
totalitarianism which emerges from the way these companies undermine
our institutions.

So, what to do? If we value the open society, we must expose these
modern apprentices to scrutiny. Open development processes are
critical here, Fujitsu would never have got away with their claims of
system robustness for Horizon if the software they were using was open
source.  We also need to re-empower the professions, equipping them
with the resources they need to have a critical understanding of these
technologies. That involves redesigning the interface between these
systems and the humans that empowers civil administrators to query how
they are functioning. This is a mammoth task. But recent technological
developments, such as code generation from large language models,
offer a route to delivery.

The open society is characterised by institutions that collaborate
with each otherin the pragmatic pursuit of solutions to social
problems. The large tech companies that have thrived because of the
open society are now putting that ecosystem in peril. For the open
society to survive it needs to embrace open development practices that
enable Popper’s piecemeal social engineers to come back together and
chant “Besen, besen! Seid’s gewesen.” Before it is too late for the
master to step in and deal with the mess the apprentice has made.}
