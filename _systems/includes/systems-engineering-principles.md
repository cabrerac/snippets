\section{Systems Engineering Principles}

\newslide{Engineering Approach}

\slides{
* Problem first approach:
    * Why is this problem important?
    * What are the people's needs?
    * What are the problem constraints?
    * What are the important variables?
}

\notes{The systems engineering approach emphasizes understanding the problem space before jumping to technical solutions. This is particularly important in data science where solutions must work within real-world constraints.}

\newslide{Systems Thinking}

\slides{
* System Views: 
    * Defining problems from different perspectives
* Agility System: 
    * Defining flexible systems architectures
* System Dynamics: 
    * Modelling the changing nature of systems
}

\newslide{Process Model}

\slides{
* Top-Down Analysis: 
    * Divide and conquer 
    * Problem decomposition
* Variant Creation: 
    * Assessing different solution alternatives
* Problem-Solving Cycle: 
    * Following defined methodology
