\notes{Arthur Balfour was quoting the lawyer James Munro[^guardian] when he said that there three types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics in 1892. This is 20 years before the first academic department of applied statistics was founded at UCL.}

[^guardian]: The quote is reported in the *Manchester Guardian* on 29th June 1892. See also <https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/lies.htm>.

\notes{As a term 'big data' promises much and delivers little, to get true value from data, it needs to be curated and evaluated. The three stages of awareness, availability and analysis provide a broad framework through which organizations should be assessing the potential in the data they hold. Hand waving about big data solutions will not do, it will only lead to self-deception. The castles we build on our data landscapes must be based on firm foundations, process and scientific analysis. If we do things right, those are the foundations that will be provided by the new field of data science.}

\notes{Today the statement "There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies and 'big data'" may be more apt. We are revisiting many of the mistakes made in interpreting data from the 19th century. Big data is laid down by happenstance, rather than actively collected with a particular question in mind. That means it needs to be treated with care when conclusions are being drawn. For data science to succeed it needs the same form of rigor that Pearson and Fisher brought to statistics, a "mathematical data science" is needed.}
