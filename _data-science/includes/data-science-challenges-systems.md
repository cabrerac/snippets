\subsection{Data Science Challenges Review}

\slides{
* Previously covered challenges:
    * Bias
    * Complexity 
    * Intellectual Debt
}

\notes{We begin by reviewing the key challenges in data science that motivate the need for an engineering approach:}

\newslide{Bias}

Systematic tendency in methods used to geather data and computer statistics that generate inaccurate depictions of reality.


* Challenges our ability to deploy safe and effective solutions:
    * Alignment
    * Fairness
    * Inclusiveness


\newslide{Complexity}

Systems are highly dynamic and have grown in size. The data processing pipelines involve hundreds or thousands of components.

Challengers our techincical ability to deploy and maintain our solutions:

    * Sustainability
    * Maintainability


\newslide{Intellectual Debt}

\slides{
* Black-box components make systems hard to understand
* Threatens human control
* Challenges our ability to explain solutions:
    * Interpretability
    * Accountability
}
