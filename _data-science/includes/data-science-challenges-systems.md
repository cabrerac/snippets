\subsection{Data Science Challenges Review}

Previously covered challenges:  

* Bias
* Complexity 
* Intellectual Debt

\notes{We begin by reviewing the key challenges in data science that motivate the need for an engineering approach:}

\newslide{Bias}

Systematic tendency in methods used to geather data and computer statistics that generate inaccurate depictions of reality.


* Challenges our ability to deploy safe and effective solutions:
    
  * Alignment
  * Fairness
  * Inclusiveness


\newslide{Complexity}

Systems are highly dynamic and have grown in size. The data processing pipelines involve hundreds or thousands of components.

Challengers our techincical ability to deploy and maintain our solutions:

  * Sustainability
  * Maintainability


\newslide{Intellectual Debt}

Black-box components make systems hard to understand and threaten human control. We know how the components work but do not know how the system works.

Challenges our ability to explain our solutions

  * Interpretability
  * Accountability
