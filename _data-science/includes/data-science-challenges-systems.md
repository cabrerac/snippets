\subsection{Data Science Challenges Review}

\slides{
* Previously covered challenges:
    * Bias
    * Complexity 
    * Intellectual Debt
}

\notes{We begin by reviewing the key challenges in data science that motivate the need for an engineering approach:}

\newslide{Bias}

\slides{
* Systematic tendency in methods that generate inaccurate depictions of reality
* Challenges our ability to deploy safe and effective solutions:
    * Alignment
    * Fairness
    * Inclusiveness
}

\newslide{Complexity}

\slides{
* Systems are highly dynamic and grown in size
* Data processing pipelines involve hundreds/thousands of components
* Challenges technical deployment and maintenance:
    * Sustainability
    * Maintainability
}

\newslide{Intellectual Debt}

\slides{
* Black-box components make systems hard to understand
* Threatens human control
* Challenges our ability to explain solutions:
    * Interpretability
    * Accountability
}
