\section{Engineering Data Science Framework}

\newslide{Data Problem}

\slides{
* Understanding stakeholders' needs:
    * Multiple viewpoints (city council, landlord, tenants)
* Understanding resources and constraints:
    * Flexible resources (cloud database)
    * Flexible architecture (library)
* Understanding data:
    * Heterogeneous data
    * Temporal features
    * Spatial data
}

\newslide{The Fynesse Framework}

\slides{
* Three key stages:
    * Access
    * Assess
    * Address
}

\notes{The Fynesse framework provides a structured approach to data science problems that aligns with systems engineering principles.}

\newslide{Implementation}

\slides{
* Process Model Application:
    * Top-down data chunking
    * Multiple data source exploration
    * Iterative improvement cycle
* Real-world data sources:
    * UK citizens and infrastructure data
    * gov.UK institutions
    * Open Street Maps
    * Learning models
}

\newslide{Summary}

\slides{
* Context is crucial for data science challenges
* Data science projects impact people directly
* Systems Engineering provides guiding principles
* Integration of principles improves outcomes
