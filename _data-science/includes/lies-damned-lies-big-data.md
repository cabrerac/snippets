\notes{If Balfour were alive today, it is likely that he'd rephrase his quote:}

\slides{
> There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies and 'big data'
>
> Neil Lawrence 1972-?
}
\notes{
> There are three types of lies, lies damned lies and *big data*. 
}
\notes{Why? Because the challenges of understanding and interpreting big data today are similar to those that Balfour (who was a Conservative politician and statesman and would later become Prime Minister) faced in governing an empire through statistics in the latter part of the 19th century.}

\notes{The quote lies, damned lies and statistics was also credited to Benjamin Disraeli by Mark Twain in Twain's autobiography.[^twain] It characterizes the idea that statistic can be made to prove anything. But Disraeli died in 1881 and Mark Twain died in 1910. The important breakthrough in overcoming our tendency to over-interpet data came with the formalization of the field through the development of *mathematical statistics*.}

[^twain]: Although Twain attributes Disraeli in this way there's [no record of him having said this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics).

\notes{Data has an elusive quality, it promises so much but can deliver little, it can mislead and misrepresent. To harness it, it must be tamed. In Balfour and Disraeli's time during the second half of the 19th century, numbers and data were being accumulated, the social sciences were being developed. There was a large-scale collection of data for the purposes of government.}

\notes{The modern 'big data era' is on the verge of delivering the same sense of frustration that Balfour experienced, the early promise of big data as a panacea is evolving to demands for delivery. For me, personally, peak-hype coincided with an email I received inviting collaboration on a project to deploy "*Big Data* and *Internet of Things* in an *Industry 4.0* environment". Further questioning revealed that the actual project was optimization of the efficiency of a manufacturing production line, a far more tangible and *realizable* goal.}

\notes{The antidote to this verbiage is found in increasing awareness. When dealing with data the first trap to avoid is the games of buzzword bingo that we are wont to play. The first goal is to quantify what challenges can be addressed and what techniques are required. Behind the hype fundamentals are changing. The phenomenon is about the increasing access we have to data. The way customers' information is recorded and processes are codified and digitized with little overhead. Internet of things is about the increasing number of cheap sensors that can be easily interconnected through our modern network structures. But businesses are about making money, and these phenomena need to be recast in those terms before their value can be realized.}
