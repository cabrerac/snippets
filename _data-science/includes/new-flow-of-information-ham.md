\notes{The Human-Analogue Machine or HAM therefore provides a route through which we could better understand our world through improving the way we interact with machines.}

The communication channel between computer and data now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction of information flow, information is reaching us mediated by the computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the machine.}{new-flow-of-information-4}

\notes{The HAM can provide an interface between the digital computer and the human allowing humans to work closely with computers regardless of their understandin gf the more technical parts of software engineering.}

\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/data-science/new-flow-of-information-ham}{70%}}{The HAM now sits between us and the traditional digital computer.}{new-flow-of-information-ham}

\notes{Of course this route provides new routes for manipulation, new ways in which the machine can undermine our autonomy or exploit our cognitive foibles. The major challenge we face is steering between these worlds where we gain the advantage of the computer's bandwidth without undermining our culture and individual autonomy.}
