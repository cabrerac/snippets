\slides{* Over emphasis on "macro economic supply interventions"
* Under emphasis on maping "micro economic demand" to "micro economic supply"}

\notes{Model is "supply chain of ideas" framework, particularly in the context of information technology and AI solutions like machine learning and large language models. You suggest that this idea flow, from creation to application, is similar to how physical goods move through economic supply chains.}

\notes{In the realm of IT solutions, there's been an overemphasis on macro-economic "supply-side" stimulation - focusing on creating new technologies and ideas - without enough attention to the micro-economic "demand-side" - understanding and addressing real-world needs and challenges.}

\subsection{Commonalities}

\notes{Key points:

1. Both cases demonstrate a significant gap between high-level policy decisions (macro) and on-the-ground realities (micro).

2. The failures stemmed from insufficient consideration of local needs, capabilities, and existing systems.

3. There was a lack of effective feedback mechanisms from the micro to macro level.

4. The implementations suffered from overly rigid, top-down approaches that didn't allow for local adaptation.

5. In both cases, there was insufficient engagement with end-users and local stakeholders.}

\notes{These examples provide valuable lessons for bridging the macro-micro gap in innovation:

1. The importance of stakeholder engagement at all levels.

2. The need for flexibility and adaptability in system design and implementation.

3. The crucial role of effective feedback mechanisms.

4. The value of phased implementation approaches.

5. The necessity of ensuring technical competence at both policy-making and implementation levels.

6. The importance of setting realistic timelines based on technical and operational realities.

7. The potential benefit of independent, technically competent oversight.}

\subsection{How ai@cam is Addressing Innovation Challenges}

\subsection{1. Bridging Macro and Micro Levels}

**A-Ideas Initiative**
- **Challenge**: Aligning high-level AI research with real-world needs.
- **ai@cam's Approach**: 
  - Fund interdisciplinary projects addressing specific societal challenges.

\subsection{6. Independent Oversight and Diverse Perspectives}

**Steering Group**

- **Challenge**: Ensuring balanced guidance and oversight.
- **ai@cam's Approach**:
  - Establish a cross-institutional Steering Group.
  - Include diverse expertise from different academic disciplines and professional services.

\subsection{7. Addressing the Innovation Supply Chain}

**Industry Engagement**

- **Challenge**: Connecting academic innovation to industry needs.
- **ai@cam's Approach**:
  - Collaborate with Strategic Partnerships Office to develop industrial partnerships.
  - Plan for an innovation initiative (sciencepreneurship at Cambridge) to bridge academic research and entrepreneurship.

\subsection{Innovation Economy Conclusion}

\notes{ai@cam's approach aims to address the macro-micro disconnects in AI innovation. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, engaging diverse stakeholders, and providing crucial resources and training, ai@cam is working to create a more integrated and effective AI innovation ecosystem.}

\notes{Our emphasis is on flexibility, phased implementation, and continuous feedback. This is to address the lessons learned from past IT implementation failures.}

\notes{*But*: AI technologies and their applications will continue to evolve rapidly, we will need to remain agile, continuously assessing and adjusting our strategies to ensure we effectively bridge the gap between high-level AI capabilities and on-the-ground implementation challenges.}
