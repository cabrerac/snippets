\notes{In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy. One consequence of the pervasive potential of technology is that it is positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution. Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing global challenges in sustainable development, technology is presented as an elixir to resolve society’s problems.

In practice, translation of technology into practical benefit is not simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and benefits from innovations are unevenly distributed across society.

When carelessly deployed, technology risks exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.}
