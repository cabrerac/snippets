\subsection{AI in Energy and Net Zero: Public Perspectives}

The energy and net zero discussions revealed support for AI's potential to optimize energy systems while raising questions about access and affordability.

\notes{Participants saw clear benefits in using AI to improve energy efficiency and grid management, but worried about creating new inequalities through technology access barriers.}

Representative quotes include:

> "Everybody being able to generate on their roofs or in their gardens, selling energy from your car back to the grid, power being thrown different ways at different times. You've got to be resilient and independent." Public Participant, Cambridge

> "Not all households can afford installing a smart system in their house or more insulation or whatever. The people who get the technology are not the people who are in fuel poverty." Public Participant, Liverpool

\notes{A key theme was ensuring AI deployment in energy systems doesn't distract from fundamental changes needed to address climate change or exacerbate existing inequalities.}
