# Public Perceptions of AI in Public Services: High-Level Findings

## Background

- 40 members of public participated in workshops in Cambridge and Liverpool
- Focused on four Mission areas: health, education, crime & policing, energy/net zero 
- Goals were to explore aspirations, concerns and potential guardrails for AI use

## Key Cross-Cutting Themes

### Role of AI
- Strong support for AI reducing administrative burden on frontline staff
- AI should act as "co-pilot" enhancing but not replacing human expertise
- Can help speed up processes and improve data sharing
- Must avoid excluding those not using digital tools

### Key Concerns
- Risk of reinforcing existing biases and discrimination 
- Over-reliance on technology reducing human interaction
- Need for transparency around AI use and decision-making
- Data privacy and security considerations

## Mission-Specific Findings

### Health
- Clear role seen for AI in NHS administration and logistics
- Support for prevention and early intervention applications
- Strong preference for human involvement in diagnosis/treatment
- Mental health seen as requiring human touch, not AI solutions

### Crime & Policing
- AI useful for data analysis and crime pattern identification
- Should not make decisions about individuals
- Must address existing trust issues in policing first
- Need safeguards against surveillance overreach

### Education  
- Strong support for reducing teacher administrative burden
- Concerns about screen time and reduced human interaction
- Mixed views on personalized learning applications
- Child safety and data privacy paramount

### Energy & Net Zero
- Support for optimizing grid and energy systems
- Questions about AI's own energy consumption
- Affordability concerns around smart technology
- Don't want AI distracting from fundamental changes needed

## Public Expectations for Guardrails

### Governance & Oversight
- Independent regulatory bodies with real power
- Multi-stakeholder involvement in governance
- Clear accountability frameworks
- Ongoing monitoring and evaluation

### Public Engagement
- Need for broad public education about AI
- Transparency about AI use in public services
- Choice and consent in AI interactions  
- User involvement in design and implementation

### Data & Security
- Context-specific data sharing rules
- Strong security against cyber threats
- Protection against misuse of public data
- Clear processes for identifying and correcting errors

### Development Approach
- Collaborative design with users and frontline staff
- Focus on public benefit over private profit
- Investment in removing bias and ensuring fairness
- Regular review and updating of systems

## Key Messages for Policy

1. Public support exists for targeted AI use to improve services, but with clear limits

2. Strong governance frameworks needed before expanding AI deployment

3. Must maintain human-centered public services while leveraging AI benefits

4. Important to address existing service challenges alongside AI innovation

5. Need for extensive public engagement and transparency around AI use

The findings suggest a pragmatic public view - seeing clear benefits from AI but wanting careful implementation with robust safeguards and ongoing public involvement in shaping its use in public services.
