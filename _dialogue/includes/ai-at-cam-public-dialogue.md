\subsection{Summary}

\notes{The public dialogue revealed several cross-cutting themes about how AI should be deployed in public services:}

* AI should enhance rather than replace human capabilities
* Strong governance frameworks need to be in place before deployment
* Public engagement and transparency are essential
* Benefits must be distributed fairly across society
* Human-centered service delivery must be maintained

\notes{A powerful theme throughout the dialogue was the desire to maintain human connection and expertise while leveraging AI's capabilities to improve service efficiency and effectiveness. As one participant noted:}

> "We need to look at the causes, we need to do some more thinking and not just start using AI to plaster over them [societal issues]." Public Participant, Cambridge
