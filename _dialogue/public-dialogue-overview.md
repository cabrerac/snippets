\subsection{Public Dialogue on AI in Public Services}

\notes{In September 2024, ai@cam convened a series of public dialogues to understand perspectives on the role of AI in delivering priority policy agendas. Through workshops in Cambridge and Liverpool, 40 members of the public shared their views on how AI could support delivery of four key government missions around health, crime and policing, education, and energy and net zero.}

\notes{The dialogue revealed a pragmatic public view that sees clear benefits from AI in reducing administrative burdens and improving service efficiency, while emphasizing the importance of maintaining human-centered services and establishing robust governance frameworks.}

\notes{Key participant quotes illustrate this balanced perspective:

> "It must be so difficult for GPs to keep track of how medication reacts with other medication on an individual basis. If there's some database that shows all that, then it can only help, can't it?" Public Participant, Liverpool}

> "I think a lot of the ideas need to be about AI being like a co-pilot to someone. I think it has to be that. So not taking the human away." Public Participant, Liverpool
