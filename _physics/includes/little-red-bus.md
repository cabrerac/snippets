\subsection{Amelia Earhart}

\notes{On 20th May 1932 Amelia Earhart took off in her Lockheed Vega from Harbour Grace in Canada. She called her plane the ‘Little Red Bus’. She travelled 2000 miles across open ocean, travelling through a storm, facing flames from her exhaust manifold, losing her altimeter. Flying until she sighted the Irish coast, tracking the coast until she saw a railway and following it until she saw a town, Londonderry. She landed nearby in a meadow.}

\notes{Earhart had navigated initially by dead reckoning and then through vision. Her hand was directly connected to the control surfaces of her plane through a series of linkages and cables. She could literally feel the plane in flight, she could respond to it and her environment to control her direction and destiny.}
