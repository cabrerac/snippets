\section{The Universe isn't as Gaussian as it Was}

\notes{Those cosmological simulations are based on a relatively simple set of 'rules' that stem from our understanding of natural laws. These 'rules' are mathematical abstractions of the physical world. Representations of behavior in mathematical form that capture the interaction forces between particles. The grand aim of physics has been to unify these rules into a single unifying theory. Popular understanding of this quest developed because of Stephen Hawking's book, "[A Brief History of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time)". The idea of these laws as 'ultimate causes' has given them a pseudo religious feel, see for example Paul Davies's book "[The Mind of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind_of_God)" which comes from a quotation form Stephen Hawking.}

\speakernotes{Nice quote but having a unifying theory doesn't give us omniscience.}
