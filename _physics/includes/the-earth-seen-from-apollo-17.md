\notes{The Blue Marble image of the earth taken from Apollo 17 which became a symbol of the environmental movement. The photo was taken in December 1972. It gave us context. An ability to move beyond our observer bias and see us as we are. Isolated, fragile, and alone. Clinging to a rock orbiting the sun.}
