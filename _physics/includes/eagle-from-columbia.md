\subsection{Eagle from Columbia}

\notes{This picture, taken by Michael Collins aboard the Columbia command module, of Eagle's return from the Moon, with the Earth in the background highlights the rendezvous radar used to to allow the crafts to dock.}

\notes{That radar was one sensing part of Eagle's many automated systems [@Mindell-digital08]. These systems could have allowed Eagle to land without human intervention, but Armstrong chose to manually place *Eagle* in the Sea of Tranquility to avoid a boulder field.}

\notes{The Apollo Guidance Computer mediated Armstrong's commands, provided through a joystick, allowing him to control the craft when he input but not providing any direct connection between him and the thrusters.}
