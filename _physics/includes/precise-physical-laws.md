\section{Precise Physical Laws}

\notes{We've already reviewed the importance of Newton's laws in forging our view of science: we mentioned the influence [Christiaan Huygens'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens) work on collisions had on Daniel Bernoulli in forming the kinetic theory of gases. These ideas inform many of the physical models we have today around a number of natural phenomena. The MET Office supercomputer in Exeter spends its mornings computing the weather across the world its afternoons modelling climate scenarios. It uses the same set of principles that Newton described, and Bernoulli explored for gases. They are encoded in the Navier-Stokes equations. Differential equations that govern the flow of compressible and incompressible fluids. As well as predicting our weather, these equations are used in fluid dynamics models to understand the flight of aircraft, the driving characteristics of racing cars and the efficiency of gas turbine engines.}
