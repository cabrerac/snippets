\slides{* Computer Lab hosts Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery
* Use ML techniques to deliver scientific advances
* Four DECAF fellows: MPhil Projects Available!}

\notes{The Computer Lab is hosting a new initiative, funded by Schmidt Futures, known as the [Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery](https://acceleratescience.github.io/). The aim is to address scientific challenges, and accelerate the progress of research, through using tools in machine learning.}

\notes{We now have four fellows appointed, each of whom works at the interface of machine learning and scientific discovery. They are using the ideas around machine learning modelling to drive their scientific research.}

\notes{For example, [Bingqing Cheng](https://acceleratescience.github.io/team/bingqing-cheng.html), one of the Department's former DECAF Fellows has used neural network accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to understand a new form of metallic hydrogen, likely to occur at the heart of stars [@Cheng-evidence20]. The University's [press release is here](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/ai-shows-how-hydrogen-becomes-a-metal-inside-giant-planets).}
