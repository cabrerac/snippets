\section{Related Approaches}

\notes{While this module is mainly focusing on emulation as a route to bringing machine learning closer to the physical world, I don't want to give the impression that's the only approach. It's worth bearing in mind three important domains of machine learning (and statistics) that we also could have explored.}

* Probabilistic Programming
* Approximate Bayesian Computation
* Causal inference

\notes{Each of these domains also brings a lot to the table in terms of understanding the physical world.}
