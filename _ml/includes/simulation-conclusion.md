\section{Conclusion}

\slides{* Introduced simulator: body of computer code.
* Emergent properties
* Abstractions
* Levels of fidelity}

\notes{We've introduced the notion of a simulator. A body of computer code that expresses our understanding of a particular physical system. We introduced such simulators through *physical laws*, such as laws of gravitation or electro-magnetism. But we soon saw that in many simulations those laws become abstracted, and the simulation becomes more phenomological.}

\notes{Even full knowledge of all laws does not give us access to 'the mind of God', because we are lacking information about the data, and we are missing the compute. These challenges further motivate the need for abstraction, and we've seen examples of where such abstractions are used in practice.}

\notes{The example of Conway's Game of Life highlights how complex emergent phenomena can require significant computation to explore.}
